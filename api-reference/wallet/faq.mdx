<Accordion title="How can I track my tokens in the embedded wallet?" icon="wallet">
  **Answer:** 

You can use the fields in the `wallet` property within the Particle Auth or Particle Connect configuration object to track tokens in the embedded wallet. Specifically, the `customStyle` object provides two properties for managing token tracking:

1. **`displayTokenAddresses`**: This property allows you to specify which token addresses should be tracked in the wallet interface.

2. **`priorityTokenAddresses`**: This property enables you to define priorities when displaying tokens.

```tsx Connectkit.tsx
    wallet({
      customStyle: {
        displayTokenAddresses: ["0x4d224452801ACEd8B2F0aebE155379bb5D594381"],
        priorityTokenAddresses: ["0x4d224452801ACEd8B2F0aebE155379bb5D594381"],
      },
    }),
```

If the icon is undetected, our team must manually add it. Please contact us to update it.

<Accordion title="Why are the transaction records in the wallet incomplete?" icon="list">
  **Answer:** Incomplete transaction records in the wallet may occur due to the large number of supported chains, particularly on testnets where detailed transaction histories are not always available. For mainnets, we strive to ensure comprehensive support. If you notice any gaps in transaction records for a particular chain, please reach out to us, and we will assess the possibility of enhancing support for that chain.

<Accordion title="Why is the token balance in the wallet not synchronized?" icon="rotate">
  **Answer:** Token balance synchronization issues may arise due to indexing delays. If you experience a significant delay in updating token balances, please contact us, and we will investigate the issue to ensure accurate and timely synchronization of your wallet balances.
