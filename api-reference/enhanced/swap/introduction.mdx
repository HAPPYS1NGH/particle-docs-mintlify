description: Explore how you can execute swap transactions with the Swap API.

The Swap API allows you to perform token swaps using decentralized exchanges with minimal hassle. Whether you're building a wallet, a DeFi platform, or any application that benefits from transparent token swaps, the Swap API provides a robust mechanism to handle these transactions.

1. If you're swapping `from` an ERC-20 token, you'll need to check token approval with `checkApprove`. If approval doesn't meet your requirements for the swap, you'll need to request approval.
2. Get a quote for the swap with `getQuote`.
3. Retrieve the swap transaction object with `getSwap`.
4. Execute the swap transaction.
