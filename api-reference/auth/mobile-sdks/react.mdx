## Particle Auth for React Native

For mobile applications, both iOS and Android, leveraging React Native for end-to-end interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service is possible through the utilization of the Particle Auth React Native SDK. The Particle Auth React Native SDK is largely adjacent to the [Flutter (Dart)](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/flutter) SDK. It enables the integration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service within mobile applications using JavaScript, providing a potentially more accessible alternative to mobile interaction with Particle Network.

Initial configuration guides, along with various examples of utilization, are detailed below.

## Getting Started

The setup process for the Particle Auth React Native SDK is relatively straightforward but deviates depending on the platform in question. However, if you've used the other Particle Auth SDKs for mobile, the general flow will feel familiar, specifically if you've used the Particle Auth Flutter SDK.

Before diving into platform-specific configuration, all Particle Auth SDKs require three standard values for initialization: `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`, all of which can be retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

<Note>Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys: [Create a new project](/resources/quickstart/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).</Note>

### Adding the Particle Auth React Native SDK to your application

Another constant in the setup process is the installation of `@particle-network/rn-auth-core`, either through npm or Yarn, depending on your preference.

```shell
npm install @particle-network/rn-auth-core
npm install @particle-network/rn-auth
```

### Android configuration

If you're planning on using Android for your React Native application, ensure you meet the following prerequisites (otherwise, expect issues or non-functionality):

- Targets **API Level 23** (Marshmallow) or higher.
- Uses **Android 6.0** or higher.
- Uses **Jetpack** (Android X).
- Uses **Java 11**.

Once you've made sure your project meets these requirements, you'll need to move on and define the aforementioned configuration values (`projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`) within your `build.grade` file (generally found at `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`). These directly link your application's instance of Particle Auth with the [dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Specifically, within `build.gradle`, you'll need to set four different values:

1. `dataBinding`, this should be enabled with `enabled = true`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
      ......
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "your project id"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "your project client key"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "your app id"
  }
  
  dataBinding {
      enabled = true
  }

}
```

***

### iOS configuration

Alternatively, if you plan to use iOS for your React Native application, the underlying setup process differs slightly. Before diving in, you'll need to ensure that your project meets the following requirements:

- **Xcode 15.0** or later.

- **iOS 14** or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `ios/{project name}.xcworkspace`.

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

From here, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY` (`clientKey`), and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to align with the snippet below; this is required for all iOS projects that leverage Particle Auth Core.

```swift Swift

// add ParticleAuthCore pods to your target
pod "Thresh", '1.4.7'
pod "ParticleMPCCore", '1.4.7'
pod "ParticleAuthCore", '1.4.7'
pod "AuthCoreAdapter", '1.4.7'

pod 'ParticleAuthService', '1.4.6'
pod 'ParticleNetworkBase', '1.4.6'
pod 'ConnectCommon',  '0.2.24'

pod 'SwiftyUserDefaults', :git ='https://github.com/SunZhiC/SwiftyUserDefaults.git', :branch ='master'
pod 'SkeletonView', :git ='https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git', :branch ='main'


post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

<Note>
<p>Specific note for using Expo.</p>
<p>If you're working with Expo, your Podfile needs additional editing to ensure compatibility with Particle Auth Core, as below:</p>

## Examples of utilization

### Initialization

Now that you've configured the Particle Auth React Native SDK according to the platform you're using, you're ready to go ahead and initialize the SDK itself, unlocking the full extent of the SDK's functionality within your application. Initialization, in this case, is a two-step process, the first of which involves importing `@particle-network/rn-auth`, in this case as `particleAuth`.

```js JavaScript 
import * as particleAuthCore from "@particle-network/rn-auth-core";
import * as particleAuth from "@particle-network/rn-auth";
```

With `@particle-network/rn-auth` imported, you'll need to call the `init` function on your representation of `@particle-network/rn-auth`, which in this case is `particleAuth`. `init` takes the following parameters:

- `chainInfo`, this refers to an object containing relevant information about the primary chain to be used. **`ChainInfo` objects can be imported from `@particle-network/chains`**.
- `env`, imported from `@particle-network/rn-auth`, and can be either:
  - `Env.Production`
  - `Env.Staging`
  - `Env.Dev`

```js JavaScript 
const chainInfo = Ethereum;
const env = Env.Production;
particleAuth.init(chainInfo, env);
particleAuthCore.init()
```

### Connect

Onboarding a user with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service (Particle Auth) happens through social login. This mechanism is controlled by `particleAuthCore.connect`. Upon calling this method, depending on specific parameters, a popup will be displayed, prompting a user to sign in with a social account, thus leading to the generation and assignment of a wallet. `particleAuthCore.connect` takes the following parameters:

- `type`, the specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, or `.facebook`.
- `account`, when `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two but required for `.jwt`.
- `supportAuthType`, the methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to log in with those as an alternative to `type`.
- `socialLoginPrompt`, either `'none'`, `'consent'`, or `'select_account'`.
- `loginPageConfig`, the specific your project name, welcome description and project icon, also support base64 image, will show when loginType is email or phone.

```js JavaScript 
import type { LoginType, SupportAuthType } from '@particle-network/rn-auth'
import * as particleAuthCore from '@particle-network/rn-auth-core';

const supportAuthType = [SupportAuthType.All];

const result = await particleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.Email, null, supportAuthType, SocialLoginPrompt.SelectAccount, {
      projectName: "React Native Example",
      description: "Welcome to login",
      imagePath: "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png"
    });
```

### Disconnect

An active session (logged-in user) can be disconnected (logged out) by simply calling this method `particleAuthCore.disconnect` for logout, 

```js JavaScript 
await particleAuthCore.disconnect();
```

### Is connected

Another important method is `particleAuthCore.isConnected`. This method returns a Boolean indicating whether a user is logged in. 

```js JavaScript 
const result = await particleAuthCore.isConnected()
```

### Get address

To retrieve the address of a currently logged-in user (EVM address if connected to an EVM chain, otherwise their Solana address), `evm.getAddress` or `solana.getAddress`can be called. 

For first-time users, only the address of the current chain will be generated. For example, if the current chain is an EVM chain, the user will only get the EVM address upon first login. If the user also needs a Solana address, they will need to call await particleAuthCore.switchChain(Solana) to obtain it. After switching successfully, the current chain will be changed to Solana, and the user can use `solana.getAddress` to get the address.

```js JavaScript 
import {evm, solana} from '@particle-network/rn-auth-core';

const evmAaddress = await evm.getAddress();
const solanaAddress = await solana.getAddress();
```

### Get userInfo

If a user has logged in, their user info (email, name, wallet addresses, and other key pieces of information) can be retrieved through `particleAuthCore.getUserInfo`. This same response will be automatically saved to a successful call of `particleAuthCore.connect`.

```js JavaScript 
const userInfo = await particleAuthCore.getUserInfo();
```

### Sign message

For the simple signature of a standard message (a string), in EVM `evm.personalSign` can be used, passing in a raw string representing the message you'd like to be prompted for signature, in Solana `solana.signMessage` can be used, passing in a base58 string. Upon calling `evm.personalSign` or `solana.signMessage`, a UI element will pop up requesting signature confirmation from the user.

```js JavaScript 
const message = "GM, Particle!"
const result = await evm.personalSign(message);

const result = await solana.signMessage(message);
```

### Sign transaction

`solana.signTransaction` is a **Solana-exclusive** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. `solana.signTransaction` simply takes a transaction string (can be a stringified object) representing a Solana transaction to be prompted for signature. Similarly to `solana.signMessage`, this will prompt a user with a popup outlining transaction details and requesting signature confirmation.

```js JavaScript 
const result = await solana.signTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign all transactions

Another **Solana-exclusive** method, `solana.signAllTransactions` is the former but plural in that it takes **an array of transactions** (string representations) to be prompted for collective signature, without pushing them to the network.

```js JavaScript
const result = await solana.signAllTransactions(transactions);
```

### Sign and send transaction

`evm.sendTransaction` is the standard method available on EVM and Solana for sending a transaction, `solana.signAndSendTransaction` is the standard method availab,e on Solana for sending a transaction. Alike `solana.signTransaction`, this will take a transaction string (serialized) to be prompted for signature. Upon receiving a signature (the user pressing "Confirm" on the resulting popup), the transaction will be sent to the network.

```js JavaScript
// An EVM transaction can either be manually constructed and serialized, 
// or you can use EvmService.createTransaction(from, data, amount, to)
const result = await evm.sendTransaction(transaction);

// You can use SolanaService.serializeSolTransction and SolanaService.serializeSplTokenTransction to create solana transaction
// or create transaction by yourself.
const result = await solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign typed data

`evm.signTypedData` is an **EVM-exclusive** method for signing structured (typed) data, as opposed to a raw string with `evm.personalSign`. This is a parallel method to `eth_signTypedData`, specifically supporting `v4`. 

`evm.signTypedData` takes a string representing typed data to be prompted for signature (can be a stringified object) alongside the version of `eth_signTypedData` to be used.

```js JavaScript
const result = await particleAuth.signTypedData(typedData);
```

### Set chainInfo

If you'd like to switch chains post-login/initialization, you'll need to call either `particleAuth.setChainInfo` for synchronous (local) chain switching, or `particleAuthCore.switchChainInfo` for asynchronous (server-side) chain switching. These will override the original primary chain selected within the`particleAuth.init`.

```js JavaScript
const chainInfo = SolanaDevnet;
const result = await particleAuthCore.switchChain(chainInfo);

const result = await particleAuth.setChainInfo(chainInfo);
```

### Get chainInfo

To retrieve an object containing the information for the currently connected chain, `particleAuth.getChainInfo` can be used.

```js JavaScript
const result = await particleAuth.getChainInfo();
```

### Open account and security page

Wallets generated with Particle Auth can be subject to a plethora of security settings, including the linkage of additional social accounts, setting a master password, payment password, and so on. To provide a user with a general, all-encompassing interface in which all security and account settings can be accessed, you'll need to use `particleAuthCore.openAccountAndSecurity`.

```js JavaScript
await particleAuthCore.openAccountAndSecurity();
```

### Set language

The language used within the modal (popups, wallet UI, security config, etc.) can also be changed; this is done with `particleAuth.setLanguage` and will take either `"en"`, "`zh_hans"`, `"zh_hant"`, `"ja"`, or `"ko"`.

```js JavaScript
particleAuth.setLanguage(language);
```

### Has master password, payment password

Additionally, a Boolean representing whether or not a user has set a master password (password upon login), payment password (password upon state-changing signature), or security account (additional phone number or email set and verified for added authentication upon security changes) can be retrieved through two ways: 

- Local retrieval with `particleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword` and `particleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword`.

```js JavaScript

const hasMasterPassword = await particleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword();
const hasPaymentPassword = await particleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword();

```

In some cases, you may want a user to set a master password or payment password (perhaps both), and thus need to either suggest or force this upon them. To do this, you'll need to use `particleAuth.setSecurityAccountConfig`, passing in two integers:

- `promptSettingWhenSign`, an integer in the range of 0 to 3 (inclusive).
- `promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenSign`, an integer in the range of 0 to 3 (inclusive).

For both of these parameters, the specific integer chosen dictates the degree to which the user is suggested to set these passwords. With `0`, these will never be suggested, `1` will suggest setting the corresponding password upon initial registration/login, `2` will show it upon every login (or for a payment password, for every signature), and `3` will force the user to go through the process of setting the password.

## `EvmService` utilization examples

Also present within `@particle-network/rn-auth` is `EvmService`, an object for facilitating additional on-chain interaction, leveraging standard and enhanced RPC endpoints. `EvmService` can either be accessed through a complete (`*`) import (such as is shown above) by using `particleAuth.EvmService.{method}` or individually importing it from `@particle-network/rn-auth`.

<Tip>For a full list of methods available through `EvmService`, take a look at the `EvmService` [SDK Reference](/api-reference/web3/data/sdk-ref).</Tip>

### Estimate gas

Given a standard transaction structure (detached set of values, as shown below), gas estimation can be run to simulate and retrieve the volume of gas to be consumed by a specified transaction (wrapper for `eth_estimateGas`). This is done via`EvmService.estimateGas`.

```js JavaScript
const result = await EvmService.estimateGas(from, to, value, data);
```

### Get suggested gas fees

To retrieve categorized gas price suggestions (3 categories scaling from low to high) based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.suggestedGasFees`. This will return a JSON object containing the above data (useful for transaction construction).

```js JavaScript
const result = await EvmService.suggestedGasFee();
```

### Get tokens and NFTs

`EvmService` also extends to Data API methods such as `getTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through calling `EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs` and passing in a given public address from which to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of. Also, you can get tokens using EvmService.getTokens or NFTs using EvmService.getNFTs.

```js JavaScript
const result = await EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress);

const result = await EvmService.getTokens(publicAddress);

const getNFTs = await EvmService.getNFTs(publicAddress);
```

### Get transactions by address

Similar to the former method, `EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress` enables the retrieval of a detailed JSON response containing the full list of transactions involving a specified address.

```js JavaScript
const result = await EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress(publicAddress);
```

### Create transaction

`EvmService.createTransaction` can help you create an evm transaction, it takes the following parameters:

- `from`, the specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, or `.facebook`.
- `data`, contract transaction parameter, if you want to send native, pass 0x
- `value`, native amount
- `to`, if it is a contract transaction, `to` is the contract address, if it is a native transaction, `to` is the receiver address.
- `gasFeeLevel`, gas fee level, support low, medium and high, default value is high.

```js JavaScript
const transaction = await EvmService.createTransaction(from, '0x', amount, to);
```
