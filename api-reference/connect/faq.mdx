<Accordion title="How do I add a custom wallet to Particle Connect?" icon="ethereum">
**Answer:** Particle Connect, out-of-the-box, supports MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, Trust Wallet, and Bitget Wallet.

Although, a custom wallet can be added given it supports application injection (the vast majority of extension-based wallets). To add an injected wallet to Particle Connect, you'll need to place `injected` from `@particle-network/connectkit` (for Web) within the `connectorFns` object.

An example of this has been included below.
```ts
import { createConfig } from '@particle-network/connectkit';
import { evmWalletConnectors, injected, walletConnect, coinbaseWallet } from '@particle-network/connectkit/evm';

const config = createConfig({
    walletConnectors: [
        evmWalletConnectors({
            },
            connectorFns: [
                injected({
                    // Replace the placeholders with information reflecting the wallet you're including.
                    target: {
                        icon: 'https://...',
                        id: 'xxx', // Wallet Unique ID
                        name: 'XXX Wallet',
                        provider: (window) => {
                            return window?.xxx.ethereum;
                        },
                    },
                }),
            ],
            // EIP-6963: Multi Injected Provider Discovery, default true.
            multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: true,
        }),
    ],
    // Other connectors...
});
```
