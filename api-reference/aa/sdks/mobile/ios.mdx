## Account Abstraction for iOS

Particle Network's AA SDK, existing at the center of its Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, facilitates flexible end-to-end utilization of ERC-4337 account abstraction, natively supporting modular smart account implementations, Paymasters, and natural Bundler usage. Within iOS applications, the Particle Network AA SDK can be used (in tandem with Particle Auth or Particle Connect) to refine user experience through account abstraction.

Details on configuration, initialization, and utilization **are listed below**.

***

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have already integrated either [Particle Connect](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/ios) or [Particle Auth](/api-reference/connect/mobile/ios) within your iOS application. If you haven't, head over to those pages, follow the configuration process, and return here. Otherwise, you can begin by including `ParticleAA` within your Podfile, as shown below:

```groovy Podfile
pod 'ParticleAA'
```

This new addition to your Podfile can then be settled and installed by running the command below:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update
```

<Note>
Important details before initialization
<p></p>
<p>Before initializing the SDK, there are a few points to keep in mind, specifically regarding the utilization of Paymasters (to sponsor gas fees, pay for gas in ERC-20 tokens, etc.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>- All Testnets automatically have the Verifying Particle Network Omnichain Verifying Paymaster enabled. Transactions requesting it will automatically be sponsored and thus gasless.</p>
<p>- On the occasion that you'd like to use the Particle Network Omnichain Verifying Paymaster for Mainnets, you'll need to deposit USDT on either Ethereum or BNB Chain within the <a href="https://dashboard.particle.network">Particle dashboard</a>. This USDT will then automatically be converted as needed into the native token of the network you're requesting (and qualifying for) sponsorship on.</p>
<p>- Alternatively, if you'd like to instead use Biconomy's Verifying Paymaster, you can head over to the <a href="https://dashboard.biconomy.io">Biconomy dashboard</a>, create a new Paymaster, and fill in `biconomyApiKeys` within `AAservice.initialize`.</p>
<p>- The Particle Network AA SDK automatically uses Biconomy's Token Paymaster; transactions that request it will be able to leverage it without additional configuration.</p>
</Note>

***

## Initialization

To begin, before using the SDK, you'll need to initialize it; without this, the `setAAService` within `ParticleNetwork` will fail or raise issues down the line. 

You can initialize the SDK through `AAService.initialize`, which requires the following parameters:

- `name`, the name of the smart account implementation to be used, the choices here are:
  - `.biconomyV1`, a [Biconomy smart account](https://www.biconomy.io/smart-accounts).
  - `.biconomyV2`, a [Biconomy smart account](https://www.biconomy.io/smart-accounts).
  - `.cyberConnect`, a [CyberConnect smart account](https://wallet.cyber.co/).
  - `.simple`, a [SimpleAccount implementation](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol).
  - `.light`, a [Light Account](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/packages/aa-accounts/light-account/).
- Optionally, `biconomyApiKeys`. If you'd prefer natively using Biconomy's Paymaster rather than the built-in Paymaster from Particle Network, then you can do so by passing in an array of `ChainInfo` objects mapped to corresponding Biconomy API keys, retrieved from the [Biconomy dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io).

Once `AAService.initialize` has been called, you'll need to use `ParticleNetwork.setAAService`, passing in an instance of `AAService`. This will tell Particle Auth to use your smart account rather than your EOA. Either before or after doing this, you'll also need to call `aaService.enableAAMode`.

```swift Swift
// the biconomy api keys can be empty collection.
let biconomyApiKeys: [Int: String] = [
  ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo.ethereum.chainId: "YOUR_BICONOMY_API_KEY",
  ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo.bnbChain.chainId: "YOUR_BICONOMY_API_KEY",
  ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo.polygon.chainId: "YOUR_BICONOMY_API_KEY",
]

AAService.initialize(name: .biconomyV1, biconomyApiKeys: biconomyApiKeys)

let aaService = AAService()
aaService.enableAAMode()

ParticleNetwork.setAAService(aaService)
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Disable AA Mode

If you'd like to disable AA mode (stop using account abstraction) after enabling it during the initialization process (through `enableAAMode`), then you'll need to call `aaService.disableAAMode`, with `aaService` being an instance of `AAService`.

However, if you aren't sure whether AA mode is enabled or not, you can call `aaService.isAAModeEnable`, which returns a Boolean representing this status.

E.g.:

```swift Swift
aaService.disableAAMode() 

let isEnable = aayService.isAAModeEnable()
```

### Get Smart Account

You can also retrieve the address of the smart account, among other details, by calling the `getSmartAccount` method on `aaService` (which can be defined by `ParticleNetwork.getAAService` if needed), in which you can pass `by` (your Signer/owner address, which should be an EOA), and `chainInfo`, which should be a `ChainInfo` object representing the chain on which you're querying account information. E.g.:

```swift Swift
let smartAccount = try await aaService.getSmartAccount(by: eoaAddress, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
```

### Send Transaction

Sending a transaction (UserOperation) is also quite simple, primarily just deviating in the fee mechanism being used for it. There are two ways to send transactions with the AA SDK. The first is with `signAndSendTransaction`, which will send a singular transaction to the network. Alternatively, you can use `quickSendTransactions` for sending batched transactions within a single UserOperation.

`ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction` takes the following parameters:

- `transaction`, a stringified standard transaction object.
- `feeMode`, the mechanism to be used for paying gas fees, can be:
  - `.gasless`, for sponsored transactions; this will happen automatically for Testnets, and will pull from your previously defined (or configured) Paymaster for Mainnets.
  - `.native`, paying for gas fees in a native token (such as ETH).
  - `.token`, paying for gas fees in an ERC-20 token (such as USDC), and thus takes one parameter:
    - `feeQuote`, to be used when leveraging a Token Paymaster.
- Optionally, `chainInfo`: a `ChainInfo` object representing the chain on which this transaction will be executed.

Alternatively, for `aaService.quickSendTransactions`, the parameters will be the same with the following exceptions:

- `transaction` being an array of transactions.
- `feeMode` is same with upon.
- `messageSigner`, which is the Signer/owner authenticating the transaction.
- `wholeFeeQuote`, which for each `feeMode` should be passed with a complete fee quote object.
- Optionally, `chainInfo` is same with upon.

E.g.:

```swift Swift
// Gasless
await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .gasless, chainInfo: chainInfo)

await aaService.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .gasless, messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo)

// Native
await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .native, chainInfo: chainInfo) 

await aaService.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .native, messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo)

// ERC-20 Token
await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .token(feeQuote), chainInfo: chainInfo)

await aaService.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .token(feeQuote), messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo)
```

Implement MessageSigner protocol

```swift Swift
class YourViewController {
  var publicAddress: String = ""
}

extension YourViewController: MessageSigner {
    func signMessage(_ message: String, chainInfo: ParticleNetworkBase.ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo?) -> RxSwift.Single<String> {
        // if you are using ParticleAuthService
        return ParticleAuthService.signMessage(message, chainInfo: chainInfo)
        
        // if you are using ParticleConnectService
        // get current adapter by walletType and publicAddress
        // here we assume currentWalletType is Metamask
        
        let currentWalletType = WalletType.metaMask
        let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().filter {
            $0.walletType == currentWalletType
        }
        if let adapter = adapters.first {
            return adapter.signMessage(publicAddress: self.publicAddress, message: message)
        } else {
            return .error(NSError(domain: "", code: 0))
        }
    }
    
    func getEoaAddress() -> String {
        // if you are using ParticleAuthService
        return ParticleAuthService.getAddress()
        
        // if you are using ParticleConnectService
        return self.publicAddress
    }
}
```

Check if you can send gasless/native/token.

```swift Swift
extension YourViewController {
    func sendTransactionInAA() async throws {
        let aa = ParticleNetwork.getAAService()!
                
        let chainInfo = ParticleNetwork.getChainInfo()
        let eoaAddress = ""
        let transaction = ""
        let wholeFeeQuote = try await aa.rpcGetFeeQuotes(eoaAddress: eoaAddress, transactions: [transaction], chainInfo: chainInfo).value
            
        if wholeFeeQuote.gasless != nil {
            // There are two ways to send gasless
            // 1, call adapter or ParticleAuthService, requires one transaction
            let txHash1 = try await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .gasless, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
            // 2, call aa, support multi transactions, requires implement MessageSigner delegate.
            let txHash2 = try await aa.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .gasless, messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
        } else {
            // you can't gasless
        }
            
        let nativeFeeQuote = AA.FeeQuote(json: wholeFeeQuote.native.feeQuote, tokenPaymasterAddress: nil)
        if nativeFeeQuote.isEnoughForPay {
            // There are two ways to send, pay token
            // 1, call adapter or ParticleAuthService, requires one transaction
            let txHash1 = try await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .native, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
            // 2, call aa, support multi transactions, requires implement MessageSigner delegate.
            let txHash2 = try await aa.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .native, messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
        } else {
            // you don't have enough native to pay
        }

        if let token = wholeFeeQuote.token {
            let tokenPaymasterAddress = token.tokenPaymasterAddress
            let tokenFeeQuotes = token.feeQuotes.map {
                AA.FeeQuote(json: $0, tokenPaymasterAddress: tokenPaymasterAddress)
            }.filter {
                // filter out balance >= fee
                $0.isEnoughForPay
            }
            if tokenFeeQuotes.count > 0 {
                // select a feeQuote, here we select the first one.
                let feeQuote = tokenFeeQuotes[0]
                // There are two ways to send, pay token
                // 1, call adapter or ParticleAuthService, requires one transaction
                let txHash1 = try await ParticleAuthService.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, feeMode: .token(feeQuote), chainInfo: chainInfo).value
                // 2, call aa, support multi transactions, requires implement MessageSigner delegate.
                let txHash2 = try await aa.quickSendTransactions([transaction], feeMode: .token(feeQuote), messageSigner: self, wholeFeeQuote: wholeFeeQuote, chainInfo: chainInfo).value
            } else {
                // you can't select token to pay
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Manually Deploy Smart Account

An undeployed smart account will automatically be deployed upon the first transaction (UserOperation) it sends through the SDK (the deployment transaction is bundled/batched with the other). If you'd like to initiate deployment manually, bypassing automatic deployment, then you can use `aaService.deployWalletContract`, which will create, request signature for, and send a deployment transaction. This method requires `messageSigner` (the Signer of the transaction), and the `feeMode` of the deployment transaction). 

The status of deployment can be retrieved with `smartAccount.isDeploy`, which takes an owner/Signer `eoaAddress`.

E.g.:

```swift Swift
let isDeploy = try await aaService.isDeploy(eoaAddress: eoaAddress).value

aaService.deployWalletContract(messageSigner: signer, feeMode: .gasless)
```
