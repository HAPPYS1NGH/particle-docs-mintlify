<Accordion title="How can I support new ERC-20 tokens for Gas payments?" icon="gas-pump">
  **Answer:** Particle Network uses the Biconomy Paymaster to sponsor transactions using ERC-20 tokens for gas fees. To support new ERC-20 tokens, it is dependent on Biconomy's integration. The availability of a token for gas payments is determined by Biconomy's supported token list.

  <Note>For a complete list of supported ERC-20 tokens, please refer to the [Biconomy documentation](https://docs.biconomy.io/supportedNetworks#supported-tokens).</Note>

<Accordion title="On which chains can I fund the Paymaster?" icon="filter-circle-dollar">
  **Answer:** You can fund the Paymaster by depositing **USDT** on either **Ethereum** or **BNB Chain** through the **Paymaster** menu on the **Particle Network Dashboard**. 
  
  The choice of chain only affects the deposit origin, not the Paymasterâ€™s functionality. Once deposited, USDT is converted to the native token of the target chain, enabling you to sponsor transactions on any supported EVM chain. 
  
  <Note>No USDT deposit is needed for testnet sponsorship.</Note>
