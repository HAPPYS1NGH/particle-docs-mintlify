<Accordion title="How can I support new ERC-20 tokens for Gas payments?" icon="gas-pump">
  **Answer:** Particle Network uses the Biconomy Paymaster to sponsor transactions using ERC-20 tokens for gas fees. To support new ERC-20 tokens, it is dependent on Biconomy's integration. The availability of a token for gas payments is determined by Biconomy's supported token list.

  <Note>For a complete list of supported ERC-20 tokens, please refer to the [Biconomy documentation](https://docs.biconomy.io/supportedNetworks#supported-tokens).</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="On which chains can I fund the Paymaster?" icon="filter-circle-dollar">
  **Answer:** You can fund the Paymaster by depositing **USDT** on either **Ethereum** or **BNB Chain** through the **Paymaster** menu on the **Particle Network Dashboard**. 
  
  The choice of chain only affects the deposit origin, not the Paymasterâ€™s functionality. Once deposited, USDT is converted to the native token of the target chain, enabling you to sponsor transactions on any supported EVM chain. 

  To view the full list of supported EVM chains, head over to the [Network Coverage](/guides/network-coverage) page.
  
  <Note>No USDT deposit is needed for testnet sponsorship.</Note>

<Accordion title="Can I use a custom smart account?" icon="file-user">
  **Answer:** The AA SDK currently doesn't offer native support for custom smart accounts. We support a select range of smart accounts:

  - **SimpleAccount**: `SIMPLE`
  - **Biconomy**: `BICONOMY`
  - **CyberConnect**: `CYBERCONNECT`
  - **Light**: `LIGHT`
  - **Xterio**: `XTERIO`

  <Tip>For more information on supported smart accounts and how to initialize them, visit the [AA SDK documentation](/api-reference/aa/sdks/desktop/web#initialization).</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I automate transactions and/or remove confirmation pop-ups?" icon="robot">
  **Answer:** Yes, with Biconomy V2, you can use **session keys** to grant users the ability to conditionally delegate signing authority. This allows for the automation of transactions and the elimination of confirmation pop-ups, providing a smoother user experience.

  <Note>Learn more about implementing [Session Keys](/guides/integrations/aa/keys) in your application.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use a custom Bundler?" icon="box">
  **Answer:** Although our SDK doesn't natively support custom Bundlers, you can still create a `UserOperation` object using the SDK. Once constructed, this object can be executed via a standard API call to your own Bundler endpoint.

  <Tip>For detailed guidance on creating and using `UserOperation` objects, check out our [API reference](/api-reference/aa/rpc/createuserop).</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use a custom Paymaster?" icon="money-bill">
  **Answer:** The AA SDK currently only supports Particle's native Paymaster, accessible via the [Particle Network Dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network), and Biconomy's Paymaster. If you wish to use a custom Paymaster, you'll need to integrate it through a custom API in your application. 
  
 After that, using our SDK, you can execute the resulting `UserOperation` (including `paymasterAndData` from your Paymaster).
