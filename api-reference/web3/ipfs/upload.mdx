## Contextualizing `upload`

- `upload` directly facilitates an upload to IPFS from a locally hosted file path. It represents the default endpoint for direct file upload and **only** takes in a `formData` object containing the targeted file path.

## Code Example

```js JavaScript
const formData = require('form-data');
const fs = require('fs');
const axios = require('axios');

const IPFS_URL = 'https://rpc.particle.network/ipfs/upload';

(async () => {
    const filePath = 'Your file path';

    const form = new formData();
    form.append('file', fs.createReadStream(filePath));

    let res = await axios.post(IPFS_URL, form, {
        headers: form.getHeaders(),
        auth: {
            username: 'Your Project Id',
            password: 'Your Project Server Key',
        },
    });

    console.log(res.data);
})();
```
