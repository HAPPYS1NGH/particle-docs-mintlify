## Contextualizing the Particle IPFS Gateway

The Particle IPFS Gateway provides a simple and quick way to retrieve information hosted on IPFS. Both files and raw JSON can be retrieved by calling their corresponding `cid` in the path parameters.

## Code Examples

```js JavaScript
const axios = require('axios');

const cid = "Your_CID_Here";
const URL = `https://ipfs.particle.network/${cid}`;

(async () => {
    let res = await axios.get(URL);
    console.log(res.data);
})();
```
