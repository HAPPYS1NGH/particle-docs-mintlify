## Contextualizing the Particle IPFS Gateway, with cropping enabled

The Particle IPFS Gateway provides a simple and quick way to retrieve information hosted on IPFS. This endpoint specifically enables the cropping and retrieval of images hosted on IPFS, with pixel-based width and height data defined in the path parameters.

## Code Examples

```js JavaScript
const axios = require('axios');

const cid = "Your_CID_Here";
const width = "Your_Width_Here";
const height = "Your_Height_Here";
const URL = `https://ipfs.particle.network/${cid}__${width}x${height}`;

(async () => {
    let res = await axios.get(URL);
    console.log(res.data);
})();
```
