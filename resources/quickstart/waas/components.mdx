## Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service

Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service refers to a collection of technologies and services that **facilitate social logins** (on-chain account creation derived from social accounts) and interaction through **application-specific embedded wallet interfaces**. Within this tech stack, multiple components work together to create a modular Wallet-as-a-Service product, allowing developers to integrate Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service to a degree that fits their specific needs as closely as possible.

Within this document, you'll find **an overview of each major component within this modular stack**.

## Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service (AA stack)

Particle Network's Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service can be separated into two distinct halves: Wallet-as-a-Service and the "Smart" component that originates from tapping into account abstraction. Within "classic" Wallet-as-a-Service, an Externally-Owned-Account (EOA) is the ending point after login. Within a Smart implementation, this EOA is used as an intermediary and instead the user is assigned a smart account to use for interaction.

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service implements various APIs and SDKs to facilitate full-stack utilization of account abstraction within accounts generated through (MPC-TSS) Wallet-as-a-Service. Thus, a user can log in using their social account and immediately create a wallet, use gasless transactions, session keys, and so on.

Within this AA stack, Particle Network has an in-house open-source Bundler in which all UserOperations are constructed and sent. You can find the source code for this Bundler on [GitHub](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-bundler-server). Alongside the Bundler, Particle Network also has its flagship [Omnichain Paymaster for multi-chain gas sponsorship](https://blog.particle.network/cross-chain-paymaster-omnichain). However, developers can also route UserOperations through any third-party Bundler or Paymaster.

As its name indicates, Particle's Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service has modularity as its main focus. It also has native, built-in support for different smart account implementations. At the moment, these are **SimpleAccount**, **CyberConnect**, and **Biconomy** V1 and V2.

## Particle Auth

Particle Auth acts as the central component responsible for handling social logins across the entirety of the Particle Network ecosystem. Specifically, Particle Auth is the primary service (and SDK) used for interacting with Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service. From onboarding to sending transactions, Particle Auth plays a major role within the Wallet-as-a-Service tech stack. All social logins (Google, Twitter, email, phone, GitHub, etc.) are routed through Particle Auth. Particle Auth can also plug into existing account systems through custom JWT-based authentication and corresponding account creation.

With powerful SDKs available across a variety of mobile and desktop platforms, Particle Auth aims to be the primary means of interacting with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service.

To learn more about Particle Auth and how to use it within your application to implement and interact with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, see [Introduction to Particle Auth](/api-reference/auth/introduction).

## Particle Wallet

Beyond onboarding with social accounts, Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service also includes native, application-embedded (and standalone) wallet interfaces for using the accounts generated by social login or, in the case of Particle Connect, any account derived from a WalletConnect-compatible Web3 wallet. The Particle Wallet modal contains various standard wallet interaction mechanisms, providing users with a central interface for account management.

Applications can embed Particle Wallet through a customizable on-screen popup for a seamlessly integrated account management tool. Otherwise, Particle Wallet can be accessed by users either through the [web application](https://wallet.particle.network) or through the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-crypto-wallet/id1632425771) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.particle.auth&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) mobile applications.

As mentioned, Particle Wallet can plug into both social accounts generated by Particle Auth or act as an infrastructure facilitating interaction with accounts generated through various external Web3 wallets. This functionality is provided through Particle Connect, which you can learn more about at [Introduction to Particle Connect](/api-reference/connect/introduction).

## Confidential zkStack

Although not yet live, Particle Network's Confidential zkStack will be built upon Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, enabling private social logins and transactions. Currently, when you log in with a social account, your Web2 and resulting Web3 identity collide and are directly linked within the backend. This is a valid concern for many, in which the solution is a ZK-powered confidential social logins provided by Particle Network's zkStack. 

Similarly, transaction and wallet privacy is a long-standing issue for public chains. Particle's Confidential zkStack will also offer a solution by implementing smart stealth addresses to enable transactional and account privacy.
