## Particle Network: The L1 Unifying All Chains Through Universal Accounts

##### Particle Network's goal is to solve the issue of Web3’s fragmentation of users and liquidity across chains.

Launched in 2022, Particle Network debuted as a Wallet Abstraction service provider, enabling users to create smart contract wallets linked to their Web2 social accounts, which can then be used natively within dApp-embedded interfaces. 

After more than 17 Million wallet activations, 10 Million UserOperations, and over 900 dApp integrations later, Particle is taking the next step in its evolution with its **L1 unifying all chains with account-level chain abstraction**.

## Modular L1

The Particle Network modular L1 blockchain powers chain abstraction by coordinating Universal Accounts and Liquidity, enabling users to have a single address and balance across every chain and pay for gas in any token.

Relying on the Cosmos SDK to build this L1 allows us to make it intrinsically modular, retaining its sovereignty while outsourcing key functions like validation and data availability to specialized ecosystem actors. This is primarily driven by Modular Nodes, which help secure the network and allow for its decentralized operation through managing transaction validation, data availability, etc. 

Our L1 features a high-performance EVM-compatible execution environment and relies on Babylon for additional security via dual staking.

Particle Network enables three core functionalities, each creating a unique user advantage:

- **Universal Accounts:** Specialized Smart Account implementations powered by Particle Network’s Universal SDK. They offer a single user address and balance across ecosystems, including heterogeneous blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana.
- **Universal Liquidity:** Unifies the liquidity of all chains through the optimistic execution of multi-chain atomic transactions. This allows users to interact with new chains without holding tokens on them.
- **Universal Gas:** Allows users to pay gas with any token (e.g. PARTI, USDT, or USDC) sourced from any blockchain, as opposed to the multi-chain ecosystem’s need for multiple chain-exclusive gas units (SOL, ETH, MATIC, etc.) All transactions are ultimately settled on Particle Network through its native token, $PARTI.

### Key modules and initial ecosystem

Particle Network is primarily constituted by three key modules. For a detailed description of these modules you can read our [Modular L1](doc:particle-chain) section.

### Design and security

Particle Network features a **dual staking system**, combining Proof-of-Stake through Tendermint with Bitcoin’s economic security and resilience, powered by **[Babylon](https://babylonchain.io)**.

Furthermore, it presents a unique data availability aggregation (AggDA) model relying on providers like [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), [Avail](https://www.availproject.org/), and [NEAR DA](https://near.org/data-availability) to reduce vendor lock-in and liveness risks. This constitutes a decentralized system of Aggregated DA node operators to dynamically publish and verify data between providers for conditional redundancy or optimization.
