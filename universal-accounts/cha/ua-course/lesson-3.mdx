In this lesson, you'll learn how to send transactions using the Universal Accounts SDK. This is the final step in building a fully functional chain-agnostic application, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers without the need for bridging or complex liquidity management.

<Note>
Before getting started, make sure you followed [Lesson 2](./lesson-2) and have your Universal Account instance initialized.
</Note>

## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers:
1. Creating a convert assets across chains transaction
2. Signing the transaction
3. Broadcasting the transaction to the blockchain

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Initialized a Universal Account (see [Lesson 1](./lesson-1))
- Display the unified balance of your Universal Account (see [Lesson 2](./lesson-2))
- Basic familiarity with TypeScript and blockchain transaction concepts

## TL;DR

This lesson covers:
- Creating a convert assets across chains transaction using the `createConvertTransaction()` method
- Signing the transaction using a connected wallet
- Broadcasting the transaction using `sendTransaction()`

### Creating a Convert Assets Across Chains Transaction

The Universal Accounts SDK allows you to create convert assets across chains transactions that convert any Primary Asset into a target token (e.g., USDT on Solana) without requiring the user to hold funds on the destination chain. 

<Note>
The Universal Account SDK allows for various types of transactions, find more details in the [Universal Accounts SDK reference](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/desktop/web).
</Note>

Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```tsx
import { CHAIN_ID, UniversalAccount, SUPPORTED_TOKEN_TYPE } from "@GDdark/universal-account";

// Create a convert assets across chains transaction
const transaction = await universalAccount.createConvertTransaction({
    expectToken: { type: SUPPORTED_TOKEN_TYPE.USDC, amount: "1" },
    chainId: CHAIN_ID.SOLANA_MAINNET,
});

console.log("Transaction Payload:", transaction);
```

### Signing the Transaction

Once the transaction is created, the object returned includes a `rootHash` that must be signed by the user. Use the `signMessage()` method from your connected provider:

Here is an example:

```tsx
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
const signature = await signer.signMessage(getBytes(transaction.rootHash));
```

### Sending the Transaction

After signing the transaction, you can broadcast it to the network as follows:

```tsx
const sendResults = await universalAccount.sendTransaction(
    transaction,
    signature
);
```

The `sendTransaction()` method returns a `TransactionResult` object, which includes the transaction ID and other metadata. You can link directly to the transaction details on **UniversalX**:

```tsx
console.log(
  "Explorer URL:",
  `https://universalx.app/activity/details?id=${result.transactionId}`
);
```

<Note>
This approach abstracts away the complexities of chain-specific gas fees and liquidity routing, making it possible to send transactions without requiring the user to hold funds on the destination chain.
