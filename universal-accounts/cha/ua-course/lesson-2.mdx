---

In this lesson, you'll learn how to fetch addresses and balances from a Universal Account. This is a critical step in building chain-agnostic applications, as it enables users to interact with their assets across different blockchains through a single interface.

<Note>
Before getting started, make sure you followed [Lesson 1](./lesson-1) and initialized a Universal Account instance.
</Note>

## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers:
1. Retrieving addresses associated with a Universal Account
2. Understanding the different address types (EOA, EVM UA, Solana UA)
3. Fetching Primary Asset balances across multiple chains

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Initialized a Universal Account (see [Lesson 1](./lesson-1))
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript and blockchain concepts

## Lesson 2 Video

The video below walks you through the process of fetching addresses and balances:

## TL;DR

This lesson covered:
- Retrieving Universal Account addresses (Owner, EVM UA, Solana UA)
- Fetching Primary Asset balances
- Understanding how assets are managed across different blockchains


### Addresses

A **Universal Account** references multiple address types:

- **Owner Address**: The EOA that owns the Universal Account and signs transactions.
- **EVM Universal Address**: The address used for interactions on EVM-compatible chains.
- **Solana Universal Address**: The address used for interactions on Solana.

You can retrieve all relevant addresses from an initialized Universal Account instance as follows:

```tsx
const smartAccountOptions = await ua.getSmartAccountOptions();

const accountInfo = {
  ownerAddress: smartAccountOptions.ownerAddress, // EOA that owns the Universal Account
  evmUaAddress: smartAccountOptions.smartAccountAddress!, // EVM UA
  solanaUaAddress: smartAccountOptions.solanaSmartAccountAddress!, // SOL UA
};

console.log("Smart Account info:", accountInfo);
```

<Note>
The EVM and Solana Universal Addresses are distinct due to the way deposits work on each network. EVM tokens should be sent to the EVM UA, while Solana tokens should be sent to the Solana UA. However, the SDK abstracts this complexity, providing a unified balance view.
</Note>

### Fetching Primary Assets

Universal Accounts can hold assets across multiple chains, but **Primary Assets** are the most critical as they are the assets spent across chains. 

You can fetch the Primary Assets balance from a Universal Account instance with a single call:

```tsx
const primaryAssets = await ua.getPrimaryAssets();
console.log("Primary Assets:", JSON.stringify(primaryAssets, null, 2));
```

<Note>
Each asset includes metadata and a breakdown of holdings per chain. For a full list of supported Primary Assets, check the [Supported Chains and Primary Assets](/universal-accounts/cha/chains#primary-assets) page.

You can find more details in the full [Universal Accounts SDK Reference](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/desktop/web).
