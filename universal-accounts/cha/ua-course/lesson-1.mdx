In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up a Universal Account after a user connects their wallet. By the end, you'll be able to initialize a UA instance that works across multiple blockchains.

Before getting started, make sure you understand the following concepts:

## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers:
1. Setting up wallet connection with Ethers.js
2. Importing and configuring the Universal Account SDK
3. Initializing a Universal Account instance
4. Configuring advanced features like slippage tolerance and gas abstraction

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Cloned the [starter app repository](https://github.com/soos3d/ua-learn-series)
- Obtained a Universal Account Project ID (Contact the Particle team to get an Access Key)
- Basic familiarity with React and Ethers.js

## TL;DR

The video covers setting up a basic Web3 dApp using `ethers.js` as the provider and then initializing a Universal Account. Here's a quick recap:

You can access and import the `UniversalAccount` class in your app as follows:

```tsx
import { UniversalAccount } from "@GDdark/universal-account";
```

Then, initialize the UA instance once a user has connected like in the following example:

```tsx  
const ua = new UniversalAccount({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UA_PROJECT_ID || "",  // Your UA Project ID
  ownerAddress: address,  // User's connected wallet address
  
  // Optional configuration
  tradeConfig: {
    slippageBps: 100,        // 1% slippage tolerance
    universalGas: true,      // Enable gas abstraction
  },
});
```

<Tip>
  The `slippageBps` value is in basis points: 100 = 1% slippage tolerance.
  Setting `universalGas: true` allows users to pay transaction fees with PARTI tokens on any blockchain.
</Tip>

You can find more details in the full [Universal Accounts SDK Reference](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/desktop/web).

You can now use the `ua` instance to fetch data (addresses and balances) and send transactions across multiple blockchains, which we'll cover in the next lessons.
