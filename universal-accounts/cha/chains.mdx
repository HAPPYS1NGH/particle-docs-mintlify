<Note>
  This list is regularly updated as support for new chains is added. All supported chains can be accessed through a single Universal Account—no separate wallets or setups required.
</Note>

## Primary Assets

**Primary Assets** are a set of key tokens with deep liquidity **that can be used for cross-chain transactions, including gas payments**. When engaging in a cross-chain operation, they're automatically selected and used by the SDK on a per-transaction basis.

<Note>
  Currently, the list of Primary Assets includes:

  - **ETH**
  - **USDT**
  - **USDC**
  - **BTC**
  - **SOL**
  - **BNB**
</Note>

When a user sends a transaction (e.g. swapping a token), the SDK will:

- Identify the optimal Primary Asset from the user’s portfolio. For example, it may select USDC on Polygon to allow a user to purchase a memecoin on Solana.
- Route liquidity across all the chains the user holds this Primary Asset using Universal Liquidity.
- Complete the transaction on the destination chain, even if the user holds **no assets on that chain**.
