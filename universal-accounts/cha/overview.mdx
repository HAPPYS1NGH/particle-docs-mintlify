## What is the Universal SDK?

**Universal Accounts** give your users a **single account and balance** across all [supported chains](/universal-accounts/cha/chains).

The **Universal Accounts SDK** allows you to integrate Universal Accounts into your dApp, allowing you to onboard users from any ecosystem without requiring them to bridge—**regardless of where your dApp is deployed**.

---

## Integration Flow

The **Universal Accounts SDK** makes it simple to integrate chain abstraction into your app with minimal code changes.

Under the hood, it’s an ERC-4337 smart account implementation. Every transaction routes through Particle’s **Chain Abstraction layer**, so balances and gas are handled across chains automatically.

### Steps to integrate
	1.	**Configure** the SDK with a single config object.
	2.	**Use** your existing provider (e.g. from RainbowKit or any other wallet connector).
	3.	**Send** transactions through the Universal Account instance.

 <Info>
 The SDK treats the user’s [Primary Assets](/universal-accounts/cha/chains#primary-assets) as a unified balance across all supported chains.
 </Info>

### What you get out of the box
	- Read balances across chains as if they were one.
	- Send transactions without adding bridging logic.
	- Gas abstraction automatically handled—no extra code required.

<Note>
  The Universal Accounts SDK uses wallet connection mechanisms. As such, if a user creates a Universal Account by connecting an existing wallet, their assets will not be automatically transferred into the UA. Users can transfer assets into their Universal Account from any supported chain via in-app flows. You may also make Universal Accounts an optional toggle within your dApp if you prefer to maintain EOAs as the default account mechanism.
