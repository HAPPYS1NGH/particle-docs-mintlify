For Particle Auth users, there are two types of passwords that can be set:

1. **Master Password**: Used to encrypt and backup the userâ€™s local MPC key shard, further increasing security by introducing an encryption layer on top of the initial social login. It is a user account's most important password. Only the user knows this password; Particle does not store it. If the user forgets it, it cannot be recovered.

2. **Payment Password**: After being set by the user, this password is used for verification before signing. Unlike the Master Password, the Payment Password can be turned off and reset by the user at any time.

## The Master Password

When a user logs into a new device, they need to enter their Master Password to activate their encryption fragment and thus be able to access their wallet. This security scheme is explained on Security (MPC-TSS).
