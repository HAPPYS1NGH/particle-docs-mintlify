Particle Auth, the core SDK responsible for driving social logins, implementation only takes a few steps.

This document will go through the step-by-step process of configuring, initializing, and using Particle Auth on Flutter.

<Note>
  For complete documentation covering the implementation of Particle Auth on Flutter in more depth, head over to the [Flutter SDK reference](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/flutter).
</Note>

Before jumping into it, ensure your project meets the following minimum requirements (otherwise, you may encounter compatibility issues).

***

<Steps>

<Step title="Installing Particle Auth">

To begin, you'll need to begin by adding `particle_auth_core` to your Flutter application; this is a requirement before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
flutter pub add particle_auth_core
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Particle Auth">

Once installed, you're ready to configure Particle Auth and initialize the SDK.

To do this, you'll need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your project ID, client key, and app ID. These are used to authenticate your instance of Particle Auth and connect your project to the dashboard; these are required to properly initialize the SDK.

To retrieve these keys, follow the steps outlined below:

For more information on the Particle dashboard, take a look at the [dashboard quickstart](/guides/dashboard).

With your project ID, client key, and app ID retrieved, you'll need to add a file named `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` to your project, then insert the aforementioned keys as is exemplified below.

### Android configuration

#### Prerequisites

- minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
- compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
- JavaVersion **17**.
- [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
- Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
- Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.

If you're building an Android application with Flutter, you must follow the steps below to configure Particle Auth. To begin, you'll need to go ahead and open your `build.gradle` file, often found at the following file path: `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`

Within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to add four new lines to ensure Particle Auth runs appropriately:

1. `minSdkVersion`, which in most cases will be set to `23`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
defaultConfig {
  applicationId "com.example.particle_auth_test"

  minSdkVersion 23 // Required by Particle Auth
  targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
  versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
  versionName flutterVersionName

  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
}
```

Staying within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to ensure that you're using version 17 of Java in both `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`, alongside enabling `dataBinding`.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

kotlinOptions {
  jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17.toString()
}

dataBinding {
  enabled = true
}
```

Finally, for dependency management, within `build.gradle` you'll need to ensure that the `repositories` object in both `buildscript` and `allprojects` has `maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }` present, such as is shown below.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
buildscript {
  ...
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }

  dependencies {
      ...
  }
}


allprojects {
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }
}

...

```

### iOS configuration

If you're building an iOS application with Flutter, this also entails a unique and iOS-specific configuration process. Before beginning, ensure your project meets the following prerequisites:

- Xcode 15.0 or later.

- iOS 14 or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `apps/{project name}.xcworkspace`.

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under `Target Membership`.

Now, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string> <!-- Replace this with your project ID -->
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string> <!-- Replace this with your client key -->
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string> <!-- Replace this with your app ID -->
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY`, and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

To enable Face ID for your app, add a usage description to your `Info.plist` file by including the following code:

```xml Info.plist
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
```

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_auth_core` is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter/blob/master/particle-auth-core/example/ios/Podfile) to complete this, if you haven't already.

<Note>
<p>Another important note before continuing.</p>
<p>Our SDK is a static library (XCFramework). When using the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, you'll need to specify that you're using a static framework through the following:</p>
<p>

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

</p>
</Note>

</Step>


<Step title="Initialize Particle Auth">

At this point, you've installed and configured Particle Auth; the only step remaining before the SDK can be used is initialization.

Particle Auth can be initialized by simply calling the `init` method on `ParticleBase`. This takes the following parameters:
  - `chainInfo`, representing the primary chain you intend to use (for example, `ChainInfo.Ethereum`, `chainInfo.Polygon`).
  - `env`, affecting the information logged within your environment (`Env.dev`, `Env.production`, or `Env.staging`).

The snippet below is an example of this.

```dart
// set the project info, get it from dashboard.
ParticleInfo.set(projectId, clientKey);
// inititilze ParticleAuth and ParticleAuthCore.
ParticleBase.init(ChainInfo.Ethereum, env);
ParticleAuthCore.init()
```

</Step>

<Step title="Facilitating social login">

You're ready to facilitate social login and interacting with the resulting accounts.

As shown below, you'll need to call `ParticleAuthCore.connect` to initiate social login, passing in the specific login type you'd like the user to use (`.google`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, etc.) alongside, if applicable, the type of account prompt used by the OAuth provider (`.select_account`, `.consent`, `.none`).

<Tip>When a user logs in for the first time, if there is no account, we will create one. Based on the current chainInfo, a new address will be generated. For example, if the current chain is EVM-compatible, only an EVM address will be generated; if it's the Solana chain, only a Solana address will be generated. If you want to obtain both addresses, you can use `ParticleAuthCore.switchChain` to switch chains, and after waiting for 2 seconds, a new address for the selected chain will be generated for you.</Tip>

```dart
final userInfo = await ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.google,
          prompt: SocialLoginPrompt.select_account);

// Additionally, you can implement custom authentication through JWT.
// Learn more: https://developers.particle.network/guides/configuration/auth/jwt
final userInfo = await ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.jwt,
          account: "the JWT");
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Examples of Utilization

### Retrieve User Information

With a user logged in, you'll be able to retrieve information about their account (such as their address, or specific details regarding the social login mechanism they used) through methods such as `Evm.getAddress` and `ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo` (`getUserInfo` returns an object with numerous points of information; to learn more, head over to its [API reference](/api-reference/auth/server/getuserinfo)).

The following snippet is an example of retrieving a user's address on both EVM and Solana alongside pulling their broader account information.

```dart
final evmAddress = await Evm.getAddress();
final solanaAddress = await Solana.getAddress();

bool isSuccess = await ParticleAuthCore.switchChain(ChainInfo.Solana);
final userInfo = await ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo();

// If you're using account abstraction through particle_aa, you'll need to retrieve their address through the following:
final accountName = AccountName.BICONOMY_V2();
final smartAccountConfig =
          SmartAccountConfig.fromAccountName(accountName, eoaAddress);
List<dynamic> response = await EvmService.getSmartAccount(
    <SmartAccountConfig>[smartAccountConfig]);
final smartAccountAddress = (response[0] as Map<String, dynamic>)["smartAccountAddress"]
    as String;
```

### Send a Transaction

Now, as a final example, you can send a transaction, such as burning 0.000000001 ETH.

To do this, you'll need to construct a transaction with `EvmService.createTransaction` using standard parameters such as `from`, `data`, `value`, and `to`,

Upon construction, the transaction can be sent through `Evm.sendTransaction`; once the user signs/confirms, it'll be pushed to the network; an example of this is shown below.

```dart
final evmAddress = await Evm.getAddress();
const receiverAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
final value = BigInt.from(0.000000001 * pow(10, 18));
const data = "0x";

final transaction = await EvmService.createTransaction(evmAddress, data, value, receiverAddress);
String txHash = await Evm.sendTransaction(transaction);
```
