Particle Auth, the core SDK responsible for driving social logins, implementation only takes a few steps.

This document will go through the step-by-step process of configuring, initializing, and using Particle Auth on React Native.

<Note>
  For complete documentation covering the implementation of Particle Auth on React Native in more depth, head over to the [React Native SDK reference](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/react).
</Note>

Before jumping into it, ensure your project meets the following minimum requirements (otherwise, you may encounter compatibility issues).

***

<Steps>

<Step title="Installing Particle Auth">

To begin, you'll need to begin by adding `@particle-network/rn-auth-core` to your React Native application; this is a requirement before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
npm install @particle-network/rn-auth-core
npm install @particle-network/rn-base

// Or

yarn add @particle-network/rn-auth-core
yarn add @particle-network/rn-base
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Particle Auth">

Once installed, you're ready to configure Particle Auth and initialize the SDK.

To do this, you'll need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your project ID, client key, and app ID. These are used to authenticate your instance of Particle Auth and connect your project to the dashboard; these are required to properly initialize the SDK.

To retrieve these keys, follow the steps outlined below:

</AccordionGroup>

For more information on the Particle dashboard, take a look at the [dashboard quickstart](/guides/dashboard).

With your project ID, client key, and app ID retrieved, you'll need to add a file named `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` to your project, then insert the aforementioned keys as is exemplified below.

### Android configuration

If you're planning on using Android for your React Native application, ensure you meet the following prerequisites (otherwise, expect issues or non-functionality):

#### Prerequisites

- minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
- compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
- JavaVersion **17**.
- [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
- Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
- Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.(before react-native:0.75.2, use 8.8)

Once you've made sure your project meets these requirements, you'll need to move on and define the aforementioned configuration values (`projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`) within your `build.grade` file (generally found at `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`). These directly link your application's instance of Particle Auth with the [dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Specifically, within `build.gradle`, you'll need to set four different values:

1. `dataBinding`, this should be enabled with `enabled = true`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
      ......
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "your project id"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "your project client key"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "your app id"
  }

  dataBinding {
      enabled = true
  }

}
```

---

### iOS configuration

Alternatively, if you plan to use iOS for your React Native application, the underlying setup process differs slightly. Before diving in, you'll need to ensure that your project meets the following requirements:

- **Xcode 15.0** or later.

- **iOS 14** or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `ios/{project name}.xcworkspace`.

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

From here, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY` (`clientKey`), and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Add Privacy - Face ID Usage Description to your info.plist file, head over to your `Info.plist` file and include the following snippet:

```xml Info.plist
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
```

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to align with the snippet below; this is required for all iOS projects that leverage Particle Auth Core.

```ruby

// add ParticleAuthCore pods to your target
pod "Thresh", '2.0.2'
pod "ParticleMPCCore", '2.0.2'
pod "ParticleAuthCore", '2.0.2'
pod "AuthCoreAdapter", '2.0.2'

pod 'ParticleNetworkBase', '2.0.2'
pod 'ConnectCommon', '2.0.2'

pod 'SwiftyUserDefaults', :git ='https://github.com/SunZhiC/SwiftyUserDefaults.git', :branch ='master'
pod 'SkeletonView', :git ='https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git', :branch ='main'


post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

<Note>
<p>Specific note for using Expo.</p>
<p>If you're working with Expo, your Podfile needs additional editing to ensure compatibility with Particle Auth Core, as below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can reference this [Podfile](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-react-native/blob/master/Expo-Examples/my-app/ios/Podfile).</p>

         target.name == 'ParticleMPCCore' or
         target.name == 'ParticleAuthCore' or
         target.name == 'AuthCoreAdapter'

         target.build_configurations.each do |config|
              config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      end
    end
end
```

</p>
</Note>

</Step>


<Step title="Initialize Particle Auth">

At this point, you've installed and configured Particle Auth; the only step remaining before the SDK can be used is initialization.

Particle Auth can be initialized by simply calling the `init` method on `particleBase`. This takes the following parameters:
  - `chainInfo`, representing the primary chain you intend to use (for example, `ChainInfo.Ethereum`, `chainInfo.Polygon`).
  - `env`, affecting the information logged within your environment (`Env.dev`, `Env.production`, or `Env.staging`).

The snippet below is an example of this.

```typeScript
// set the project info, get it from dashboard.
ParticleInfo.projectId = ''; // your project id
ParticleInfo.clientKey = ''; // your client key

// inititilze particleBase and particleAuthCore.
const chainInfo = Ethereum;
const env = Env.Dev;
particleBase.init(chainInfo, env);
particleAuthCore.init();
```

</Step>

<Step title="Facilitating social login">

You're ready to facilitate social login and interacting with the resulting accounts.

As shown below, you'll need to call `particleAuthCore.connect` to initiate social login, passing in the specific login type you'd like the user to use (`.Google`, `.Twitter`, `.Discord`, etc.) alongside, if applicable, the type of account prompt used by the OAuth provider (`.SelectAccount`, `.Consent`, `.None`).

<Tip>When a user logs in for the first time, if there is no account, we will create one. Based on the current chainInfo, a new address will be generated. For example, if the current chain is EVM-compatible, only an EVM address will be generated; if it's the Solana chain, only a Solana address will be generated. If you want to obtain both addresses, you can use `ParticleAuthCore.switchChain` to switch chains, and after waiting for 2 seconds, a new address for the selected chain will be generated for you.</Tip>

```typeScript
const userInfo = await particleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.google, null, supportAuthTypes, SocialLoginPrompt.SelectAccount);

// Additionally, you can implement custom authentication through JWT.
// Learn more: https://developers.particle.network/guides/configuration/auth/jwt
const userInfo = await particleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.JWT, jwt);
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Examples of Utilization

### Retrieve User Information

With a user logged in, you'll be able to retrieve information about their account (such as their address, or specific details regarding the social login mechanism they used) through methods such as `evm.getAddress` and `particleAuthCore.getUserInfo` (`getUserInfo` returns an object with numerous points of information; to learn more, head over to its [API reference](/api-reference/auth/server/getuserinfo)).

The following snippet is an example of retrieving a user's address on both EVM and Solana alongside pulling their broader account information.

```typeScript
const evmAddress = await evm.getAddress();
const solanaAddress = await solana.getAddress();

const isSuccess = await particleAuthCore.switchChain(Solana);
const userInfo = await particleAuthCore.getUserInfo();

// If you're using account abstraction through @particle-network/rn-aa, you'll need to retrieve their address through the following:
const smartAccountParam = {
    name: AccountName.BICONOMY_V2().name,
    version: AccountName.BICONOMY_V2().version,
    ownerAddress: eoaAddress,
};
const result: SmartAccountInfo[] = await EvmService.getSmartAccount([smartAccountParam]);
const smartAccountAddress = result[0]?.smartAccountAddress;
```

### Send a Transaction

Now, as a final example, you can send a transaction, such as burning 0.000000001 ETH.

To do this, you'll need to construct a transaction with `EvmService.createTransaction` using standard parameters such as `from`, `data`, `value`, and `to`,

Upon construction, the transaction can be sent through `Evm.sendTransaction`; once the user signs/confirms, it'll be pushed to the network; an example of this is shown below.

```typeScript
const evmAddress = await evm.getAddress();
const receiverAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
const value = BigNumber(0.000000001 * Math.pow(10, 18));
const data = "0x";

const transaction = EvmService.createTransaction(evmAddress, data, value, receiverAddress);
const txHash = await evm.sendTransaction(transaction);
```
