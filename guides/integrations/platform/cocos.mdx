## SDKs with Cocos Support

Particle Network supports Cocos (Cocos2d) natively. Currently, SDK support for Cocos is limited to JavaScript/TypeScript within the standard Particle Auth SDK. Like Unreal Engine, Particle Auth alone is plenty to facilitate end-to-end integration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service directly within your application built using Cocos. 

To help you get started, we've created comprehensive tutorials and SDK references that guide you through the process of integrating Particle Auth into your Cocos applications. The up-to-date integration guide can be found through the cards below:

We also invite you to explore the [`particle-cocos` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-cocos/tree/mobile).
