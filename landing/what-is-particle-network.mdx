# Live Products: Wallet Abstraction

Launched in 2022, Particle Network debuted as a Wallet Abstraction service provider, enabling users to create smart contract wallets linked to their Web2 social accounts. These wallets can be accessed on their own or within dApp-embedded interfaces, and have been widely implemented across the Web3 ecosystem, with over 17 Million wallet activations, 10 Million UserOperations, and 900 dApp integrations.

Particle Network's live Wallet Abstraction product suite consists of three key technologies:

1. **User Onboarding**
2. **Account Abstraction**
2. **BTC Connect**
3. **Upcoming Products: Chain Abstraction**

### User Onboarding

Particle Auth and Particle Connect offer social login and multi-channel onboarding options, including social accounts, email, and phone numbers. Additionally, Particle Connect supports onboarding through standard Web3 wallets using Wallet Connect.

### BTC Connect

Based on the foundations of Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, BTC Connect is the first account abstraction protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing native Bitcoin users to use wallets such as UniSat or Xverse on EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer-2s.

BTC Connect implements ERC-4337 account abstraction throughout the EVM-compatible Bitcoin ecosystem, taking advantage of a Bitcoin-specific smart contract wallet model in which the signer is a Bitcoin account.

# Upcoming Products: Chain Abstraction

## Chain-Agnostic Experience Through Universal Accounts

##### Particle Network's goal is to solve Web3â€™s fragmentation of users and liquidity across chains.

As an evolution of its Wallet Abstraction products, Particle is taking the next step in its evolution, offering users a borderless Web3 experience through **Universal Accounts**.

## Universal Account SDKs

Particle Network's **Chain Abstraction** tools empower developers to create chain-agnostic applications, offering users a seamless and unified experience across multiple blockchains. These tools eliminate the need for manual asset bridging and simplify cross-chain asset management.  

### Key Features  

- **Unified Balance**: Provides a consolidated view of assets across multiple blockchains, allowing users to manage all holdings through a single interface.  
- **Automatic Asset Bridging**: Ensures seamless transactions by automatically settling them using the user's assets, regardless of asset type, target chain, or location.  

Chain Abstraction is implemented through two SDKs: **UniversalX** and **Universal Accounts**.
