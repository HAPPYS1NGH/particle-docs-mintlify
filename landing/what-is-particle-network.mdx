# Live Products: Wallet Abstraction

Launched in 2022, Particle Network debuted as a Wallet Abstraction service provider, enabling users to create smart contract wallets linked to their Web2 social accounts. These wallets can be accessed on their own or within dApp-embedded interfaces, and have been widely implemented across the Web3 ecosystem, with over 17 Million wallet activations, 10 Million UserOperations, and 900 dApp integrations.

Particle Network's live Wallet Abstraction product suite consists of three key technologies:

1. **User Onboarding**

2. **Account Abstraction**

3. **Upcoming Products: Chain Abstraction**

### User Onboarding

User Onboarding can be streamlined through Wallet Abstraction via two core SDKs: Particle Auth and Particle Connect. These offer multiple onboarding options for users to tie a Web2 login to a newly-created crypto wallet via their social accounts, email, and phone numbers. Additionally, Particle Connect supports onboarding through standard Web3 wallets using Wallet Connect.

### Account Abstraction

The AA SDK enables developers to leverage Account Abstraction via ERC-4337 Smart Accounts, unlocking features such as gasless transactions and session keys to enhance their dApps' user experience.

# Upcoming Products: Chain Abstraction

## Chain-Agnostic Experience Through Universal Accounts

##### Particle Network's goal is to solve Web3â€™s fragmentation of users and liquidity across chains.

Its core chain abstraction product offering, **Universal Accounts** ("One account, one balance, any chain"), unlocks a borderless Web3 experience by allowing users to interact with the entire Web3 ecosystem through a single account.&#x20;

## Universal SDK

Developers will be able to integrate Universal Accounts into their dApps through the upcoming Universal SDK, facilitating the creation of chain-agnostic dApps.
