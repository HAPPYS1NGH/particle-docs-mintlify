Web3's largest UX problem lies in the proliferation of L1, L2, and L3 blockchains, leading to fragmented user bases and liquidity. The solution to this problem receives the name of *chain abstraction.*

## What is chain abstraction?

Web3's fragmentation creates siloed and incompatible ecosystems, stunting its growth and limiting its reach to technically-aware users. As a solution, chain abstraction is "a user experience exempt from the manual processes required to interact with multiple chains" (the latter of which may involve managing multiple wallets, gas tokens, bridging across chains, etc.)

A fully chain-abstracted experience can look as follows:

1. Alice discovers a Play-to-Earn dApp. The dApp is hosted on Arbitrum.

2. Alice starts using the dApp. The assets in her wallet (Polygon-native) are used for basic dApp interactions. Bridging is automatic, executed atomically by her Universal Account as she interacts.

3. After playing for a bit, Alice earns some tokens. She uses them to buy an NFT for her friend Bob’s birthday. Unbeknownst to her, the NFT is hosted on Optimism. She can seamlessly send it to Bob’s Universal Account. Importantly, throughout her whole experience, Alice has only used a single gas token. Bob decides to take a loan against the NFT on Solana and use the proceeds to buy a meme Bitcoin Ordinal. He does this in just a few clicks within a few minutes, all through the same account.
