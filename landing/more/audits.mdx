title: "Security Audits"
---

> 🏅 Particle Network has undergone multiple audits, both private and public, to uphold the highest standards of security. We have partnered with [Salus Sec](https://salusec.io/) for private audits, while also opting for industry-leading security firms like [CertiK](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/particle-network) and [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/particle-network-btc-smart-account-audit) for public audits.
> 
> Particle Network regularly has its codebase audited to ensure a constant baseline of security. As a result of these rigorous efforts, Particle Network currently holds the impressive rank of [second place](https://skynet.certik.com/leaderboards/non-token) globally for non-token audits by CertiK. This achievement reflects our strong dedication to transparency and best practices in the Web3 space.
> 
> In addition to the audits, Particle Network also runs a continuously active bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK, encouraging security researchers and ethical hackers to report any vulnerabilities. This initiative further solidifies our proactive stance on security. You can view more details about the bug bounty program and participate [here](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/particle-network).
