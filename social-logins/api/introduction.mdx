# Enhanced APIs

Alongside Particleâ€™s Wallet-as-a-Service and Account Abstraction SDKs, we provide a set of **Enhanced APIs**.  
These APIs are designed for **fast, flexible blockchain interactions**, such as:

- Retrieving detailed wallet and token data  
- Constructing ERC-20 swap transactions  
- Reading and writing blockchain data programmatically  

<Note>Many of these capabilities are already built into Particle SDKs.</Note>

The Enhanced APIs section gives you a **transparent look at all available endpoints**, with examples and an interactive playground for testing.
