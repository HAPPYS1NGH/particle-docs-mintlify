## Why Security Matters

Private keys are the foundation of blockchain ownership. Any WaaS (Wallet-as-a-Service) solution must guarantee secure key management.  

Particle Network’s security model is built on four principles:  

- Only the **user** controls their keys.  
- Only the **user** can initiate signing.  
- Accounts must be **recoverable** across devices.  
- No **single point of failure** should ever exist.  

To achieve this, Particle replaces the traditional single private key with a **multi-share system** using **MPC-TSS**.

## What is MPC-TSS?

**Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)** split a secret (the private key) into multiple shares. The full key never exists in one place — even during generation.  

- A subset of shares (e.g., 2/2 or 3/5) is enough to generate a signature.  
- Keys can be refreshed periodically, improving resilience.  
- MPC (Multi-Party Computation) ensures computations are done collaboratively without revealing the key.  

This combination means **no entity ever has access to the full private key**.

## Particle’s 2/2 MPC-TSS Approach

Particle uses a **2/2 TSS model**:  

- **Share 1**: stored locally on the user’s device.  
- **Share 2**: stored in Particle’s **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**.  

Key facts:  
- The two shares are never combined, not even during signing.  
- Each share reveals nothing about the private key on its own.  
- Continuous key refresh makes compromise virtually impossible.  

Users can also add a **[Master Password](/social-logins/configuration/auth/password)** to encrypt their local share, providing:  
- Extra protection on top of social login.  
- Secure cross-device wallet recovery.

## Supported Cryptographic Algorithms

Particle implements secure MPC versions of:  

- **2-Party EdDSA** — Solana  
- **2-Party ECDSA** — EVM chains

This makes the system **non-custodial, chain-agnostic, and highly secure**.

## Infrastructure Security

Beyond MPC-TSS, Particle’s infrastructure follows strict security standards:  

- End-to-end TLS encryption  
- Segregated public/private networks  
- Intrusion detection monitoring  
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)  
- Dedicated Trustee TSS Party-2 Server  

These measures ensure a secure foundation for all applications built on Particle.
