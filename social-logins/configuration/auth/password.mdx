description: "Overview of the two types of passwords available in Particle social logins SDKs."
---

Within **Particle social logins SDKs**, users can set up two different passwords. Each serves a distinct purpose in securing accounts and authorizing actions.

***

## Master Password

- **Purpose:** Encrypts and backs up the user’s local MPC key share.  
- **Ownership:** Known only to the user — Particle never stores it.  
- **Recovery:** Cannot be reset or recovered if forgotten.  
- **Usage:** Provides an additional encryption layer for secure wallet recovery across devices.  

<Note>If the user forgets the Master Password, the encrypted key shard becomes inaccessible.</Note>

***

## Payment Password

- **Purpose:** Used as a second verification step before signing transactions.  
- **Flexibility:** Can be disabled or reset by the user at any time.  
- **Experience:** Adds a layer of security without affecting wallet recovery.
