## Particle Auth the core component of Particle WaaS

**Particle Auth** is the core SDK for **wallet creation** and **account interaction**, powered by Particleâ€™s Wallet-as-a-Service.  

It supports **social logins** out of the box and gives you **full control over the UI and user flow** for a branded onboarding experience.

The SDK is available on **web, desktop, and mobile**, with support across major platforms.
