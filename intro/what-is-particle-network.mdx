# Powering chain abstraction through Universal Accounts

Particle Network enables **chain abstraction** for the entire Web3, **solving the fragmentation of users and liquidity**. It does so through its flagship product, **Universal Accounts**.

## Chain Abstraction

Chain abstraction enables users to experience dApps across all blockchains with a single, unified balance, aggregating assets they hold across all of Web3.

## Universal Accounts

Universal Accounts enable chain abstraction by giving users a single account and balance across all of Web3. They enable the following features:

- **One account, one balance, any chain**: A combined balance of assets from every chain a user holds funds on.
- **Chain-agnostic**: Transact and interact with dApps without bridging or thinking about different blockchain networks.
- **Universal Gas**: Pay fees in any token from any chain.
