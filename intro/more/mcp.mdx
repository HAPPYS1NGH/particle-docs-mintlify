The Particle docs host a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets AI applications query our documentation directly. This enables developers to build AI tools and assistants with first-class access to guides, API references, and implementation details.

---

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard for connecting AI systems to external tools and data sources.  
With MCP, AI models can extend their capabilities beyond static training data by retrieving real-time, contextual information.

Particle Network’s MCP server bridges AI applications and our documentation, allowing AI systems to:

- Search across the full documentation knowledge base
- Retrieve relevant guides, API references, and code snippets
- Provide contextual answers with direct links back to docs

That section can be clearer and more consistent with the rest of the doc. Right now it’s short and doesn’t set expectations for developers (what “MCP-compatible” means, why it matters, etc.). Here’s a tighter, more useful rewrite:

## Connecting to Particle Network’s MCP Server

To use the Particle MCP server, your AI application must support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Many modern AI tools and IDEs already provide native support.

Some examples include:

- **Windsurf IDE**: an AI-powered IDE with built-in MCP integration.
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic’s coding assistant with MCP support.
- **Any other MCP-compatible client**: custom tools or assistants that can connect to a streamable HTTP MCP endpoint.

You’ll connect these clients to the following server URL:

```sh URL
https://developers.particle.network/mcp
```

## Available Tools

Currently, the Particle MCP server exposes one tool:

`SearchParticleNetworkDocs`

A search endpoint for querying the entire Particle Network documentation knowledge base. It returns contextual content along with titles and direct links to the docs.

Use this tool when you need to:
- Answer technical questions about Particle Network features
- Locate integration guides and API references
- Retrieve implementation details and code samples
- Provide contextual answers with links back to official docs

## Integration Instructions

### Using Windsurf IDE

Windsurf is an AI-powered IDE with built-in MCP support. You can connect it to the Particle Network docs in a few steps:

1. Navigate to `Advanced Settings → Cascade → Manage MCPs`.
2. Click `View Raw Config` and paste the following snippet:

```json mcp_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "particle-docs": {
      "serverUrl": "https://developers.particle.network/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
Once added, Windsurf will automatically use the MCP server to query Particle’s documentation inside Cascade — giving your IDE real context about Particle SDKs, APIs, and integration details.

### Manual Configuration

For other AI tools that support streamable HTTP MCP (the current MCP standard, replacing older SSE connections), you can connect directly using the following URL:

```sh URL
https://developers.particle.network/mcp
```

This provides full access to Particle Network’s documentation and developer resources via MCP.
