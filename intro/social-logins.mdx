**Social Logins** let users sign in to dApps using credentials they already know — Google, Twitter, Discord, Apple, and more — while automatically generating a secure, non-custodial wallet in the background.

This eliminates the friction of seed phrases and manual wallet setup, allowing developers to offer a **Web2-like onboarding experience** without sacrificing decentralization. Particle Network ensures keys are safely managed using [MPC (Multi-Party Computation)](/api-reference/wallet-abstraction/waas/mpc-tss), keeping control in the user’s hands.

# Understanding Social Logins

From a technical standpoint, Social Logins work by binding a user’s Web2 identity (e.g., Google OAuth) to a non-custodial wallet. Particle’s infrastructure abstracts away key management, ensuring wallets can be recovered while staying decentralized.

## Key Features

### User Experience
- One-click onboarding with familiar Web2 credentials.  
- No need for seed phrases, extensions, or manual wallet creation.  
- Fast, familiar login flow users already trust.

### Developer Benefits
- Easy SDK integration with minimal code changes.  
- Works across web, mobile, and desktop environments.  
- Fully compatible with other Particle products (Universal Accounts, Account Abstraction).
