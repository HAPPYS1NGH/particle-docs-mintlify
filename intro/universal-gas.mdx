**Universal Gas** lets users pay transaction fees using **any token**, even if it’s from a different blockchain (e.g., they can pay for Solana transactions using USDC on Optimism).

This eliminates the friction of users needing to manage multiple native tokens across chains to use dApps. Universal Gas is handled automatically by Particle Network’s infrastructure on dApps that integrate the Universal Accounts SDK. Thanks to it, users never need to think about swapping or bridging tokens just to cover fees.

## Using Universal Gas within your dApp

When transactions are executed through a Universal Account, Particle Network's dApp-embedded modal—enabled through the [Universal SDK](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/overview)— will prompt the user to choose the token they'd like to pay gas fees with. From this point, users can choose between multiple tokens, which are automatically consumed from their combined multi-chain balance through Particle Network's Paymaster.

All gas payments are eventually settled in the source and target chains, with a portion of the fee automatically routed and converted into $PARTI to settle the transaction on the **Particle Chain (Particle Network's L1 blockchain, which orders and coordinates cross-chain transactions)**.
