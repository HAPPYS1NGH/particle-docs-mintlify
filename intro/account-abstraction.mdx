**Account Abstraction (AA)** brings smart account capabilities to users, enabling features like gasless transactions, batched operations, and programmable account logic.  

Particle Network provides a full-stack **Account Abstraction SDK**, designed for developers who want to implement **ERC-4337 Smart Wallet-as-a-Service** with minimal effort. Whether paired with **Particle Auth** (MPC-secured EOAs) or integrated externally, the SDK handles the heavy lifting of smart account deployment and UserOperation management.

# Understanding Account Abstraction

From a technical standpoint, Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) separates account logic from EOAs, replacing them with **Smart Accounts**. These programmable accounts allow for improved UX while staying fully decentralized.  

The **Particle AA SDK** enables developers to:  
- Deploy smart accounts bound to EOAs (MPC-secured via Particle Auth or external).  
- Construct, sponsor, and send **UserOperations**.  
- Retrieve fee quotes and handle gas sponsorship.  
- Support recovery flows and custom logic.

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Gasless transactions** through paymaster sponsorship.  
- **Batched operations** (e.g., approve + swap in one click).  
- **Programmable logic** for recovery, spending limits, or custom policies.  

### Developer Benefits
- **Full ERC-4337 support** out of the box.  
- Works natively with Particle Auth (MPC EOAs) or external wallets.  
- Simple SDK integration for constructing, simulating, and sending UserOperations.
