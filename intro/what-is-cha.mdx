# Chain Abstraction

**Chain abstraction** removes the friction of dealing with multiple blockchains.  
With **Universal Accounts**, users and developers interact with Web3 as if it were one unified environment.

---

## What It Means for Users

- **One account, one balance** across all chains.  
- **Use any token as gas** on any transaction.  
- **No bridges or chain switching** required.

---

## What It Means for Developers

- Build your dApp on one chain, serve users from all of them.  
- No need to manage cross-chain deployments.  
- Unified liquidity handled automatically in the background.  

---

## Key Properties

1. **Unified Balance** → All assets across chains combined into one spendable balance.  
2. **Liquidity Routing** → Cross-chain liquidity handled seamlessly, no manual swaps.  
3. **Universal Gas** → Pay fees with any token from any chain.
