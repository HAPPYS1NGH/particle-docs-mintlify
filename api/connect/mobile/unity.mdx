## Particle Connect for Unity

Particle Connect acts as a central wallet connection mechanism within games built on Unity. With it, you can onboard users into a completely functional account through either social logins (via Particle Auth) or typical Web3 wallets (via WalletConnect, Solana's `wallet-adapter`, or private key imports). This creates a Web2-adjacent login experience while retaining unified compatibility with existing popular Web3 wallets. 

Particle Connect has a dedicated Unity SDK for integration; the configuration process and examples of utilization **are outlined below.**

## Repository

Before diving in, all of the Particle Network Unity SDKs (for Particle Auth and Particle Connect) are publicly available and viewable through the [official repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity). Feel free to look at the underlying architecture and demos showcasing end-to-end implementation for an initial understanding of working with Particle Connect on Unity.

<Warning>
It is strongly discouraged to use a private key or the mnemonic import/generate function. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself, as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To start, your Unity project will need to meet several requirements to avoid any compatibility issues. These requirements will be, in some capacity, dependent on the platform that you've decided to use. They are as follows:

- **Unity 2021.3.35f1** or higher.
- If you're using iOS:
  - **Xcode 15.0** or higher.
  - **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher.
  - **iOS 14** or higher.
- If you're using Android:
  - **Minimum API level 23** or higher.
  - **Targets API level 33** or higher.
  - **Java SDK version 11**.

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Once you've ensured that your project meets the above prerequisites, you'll also need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These directly connect your Unity project with the Particle dashboard, enabling customization, analytics, tracking, etc. To retrieve these, you'll need to head into the dashboard and create a new project, then a new application, as shown below:

1. Sign up/log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>

2. Create a new project or enter an existing project.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

3. Create a new application, or skip this step if you already have one.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

4. Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>


### Configuration

With these values retrieved, you can move on to initial configuration and dependency management. This will vary in complexity depending on the platform used. To begin, for both iOS and Android, you'll need to download and install the Particle Unity package; this will include the necessary files for both Particle Connect and Particle Auth. 

Head over to the [`particle-unity` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/releases), and download the latest release (`.unitypackage`), then import this into your project.

#### iOS configuration

If you're building a Unity game on iOS, you must follow a specific configuration process to ensure that Particle Connect functions. The first step within this process is to set up a scheme URL within the Unity editor.

1. Head into the [iOS Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html) menu (`Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player Settings` -> `iOS`).
2. From here, select `Other`, then scroll down to `Configuration`.
3. Open the `Supported URL schemes` section, and within the `Element 0` field, paste in your `projectId` with a prefix of `pn`.
   1. For example, if your `projectId` (from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network)) is something like `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL, in this case, would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`

<Note>
Remove other services, if needed:
<p></p>
<p>Within `ParticleNetworkIOSBridge.cs`, you'll have a number of services included in the SDK:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- `ParticleNetworkBase` - required, universally.</p>
<p>- `ParticleWalletGUI` - usage of the Particle Wallet UI, contains all services.</p>
<p>  - Requires [`SkeletonView`](https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git).</p>
<p>- `ParticleConnect` - for Particle Connect.</p>
<p>- `ParticleAuthCore` - for Particle Auth Core.</p>

</Note>

You'll also need to configure your Podfile if you haven't already. If you don't have a Podfile, go to the root of your project directory and run `pod init`, this will generate a Podfile

Open this Podfile, and insert the specific pods (services) you'd like to use within your project. In this case, `ParticleConnect` and `CommonConnect` will generally suffice, but additional services can be added if needed.

Additionally, you'll need to paste in the below code snippet for installation handling:

```groovy Podfile
pod 'ParticleWalletGUI'
// If you're using this, also include:
// pod 'SkeletonView', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git', :branch => 'main'

pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'CommonConnect'

// Paste this
post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

With your Podfile set, you'll need to run `pod install` and open your `.xcworkspace` file, as shown below:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update

open {your project}.xcworkspace
```

Finally, for iOS, you'll need to formally use the `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` previously retrieved. To do this, head into the root of your Xcode project and create a file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Within this file, paste the following text (then replace the placeholders):

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Android configuration

If you're building your Unity game for Android, you'll just need to configure two files before you're ready to go. The first of these two files can be found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/launcherTemplate.gradle` within your project. Here, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies included.

Specifically, you'll need the following dependencies at a minimum:

- `network.particle:auth-service`if you're planning on using Particle Auth directly.
- `network.particle:connect`, required for Particle Connect.
- `network.particle:unity-bridge`, required universally.
- Additional dependencies, optional:
  - `network.particle:chains`, collection of `chainInfo` objects.
  - `network.particle:connect-solana-adapter`, Solana-specific custom wallet adapter to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-phantom-adapter`, Wallet adapter for Phantom to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-evm-adapter`, EVM-specific custom wallet adapter to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-auth-adapter`, Particle Auth adapter for Particle Connect (social logins).
  - `network.particle:connect-wallet-connect-adapter`, WalletConnect adapter for Particle Connect.  
    The full list of `network.particle` packages can be found [here](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g:network.particle&smo=true).

```groovy launcherTemplate.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':unityLibrary') 
    implementation "network.particle:auth-service:${sdkVersion}"
    implementation "network.particle:unity-bridge:${sdkVersion}"
  	implementation "network.particle:connect:${sdkVersion}"
  	// Other dependencies
}
```

Finally, for Android, you'll need to place your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` within `gradleTemplate.properties`, found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties`.

```groovy gradleTemplate.properties
particle.network.project_client_key=Your Client Key
particle.network.project_id=Your Project ID
particle.network.app_id=Your App ID
```

***

## Initialization

Now that you've managed the relevant dependencies and configured your Unity environment, you'll need to initialize `ParticleNetwork` and `ParticleConnectInteraction` (both derived from `Network.Particle.Scripts.Core`) before moving on. This is required for Particle Connect to function.  

`ParticleNetwork` can be initialized by simply calling `Init` and passing in a `chainInfo` object (\*). `ParticleConnectInteraction.Init` will require both a `chainInfo` object and a `DAppMetaData` parameter (in this example, represented as `metadata`) containing a WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the WalletConnect dashboard, alongside the name of your project, the icon (preferably 512x512), the website URL, and a project description.

Additionally, with WalletConnect as the underlying infrastructure for Web3 wallets within Particle Connect, you'll also have the opportunity to include configuration for multiple different chains on WalletConnect by calling `ParticleConnectInteraction.SetWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos` and passing in an array of `chainInfo` objects.

An example of the above process can be found below.

```csharp C#
var metadata = new DAppMetaData(TestConfig.walletConnectProjectId,"Particle Connect",
            "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
            "https://connect.particle.network",
            "");

ParticleNetwork.Init(_chainInfo);
ParticleConnectInteraction.Init(_chainInfo, metadata);

List<ChainInfo> chainInfos = new List<ChainInfo>
                { ChainInfo.Ethereum, ChainInfo.EthereumSepolia, ChainInfo.EthereumSepolia };
ParticleConnectInteraction.SetWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos(chainInfos.ToArray());
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Set Chain Info

Before a user has connected, if you'd like to set the primary chain after initialization through `.Init`, you can call `ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo`, passing in a corresponding `chainInfo` object for the chain you'd like to switch to. Alternatively, if you only support evm chains, `ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo` is enough, you can call it anytime, if you support both evm and solana, `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SwitchChain` or `ParticleAuthService.Instance.SetChainInfoAsync` should be called when switch from an evm chain to solana or switch from solana to an evm chain. E.g:

```csharp C#
ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo(_chainInfo);

// Alternatively, if you are using WalletType.authCore
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SwitchChain(_chainInfo);

// Alternatively, if you are using WalletType.particle
await ParticleAuthService.Instance.SetChainInfoAsync(_chainInfo);
```

### Connect Wallet

Within implementations of Particle Connect, `Connect` drives connection with a wallet in the Particle Connect stack, (social login or otherwise.) This is done through `ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect`, then passing in a relevant `WalletType` object, derived from `Network.Particle.Scripts.Model`

`WalletType` is an `enum` containing the following choices:

- `AuthCore`, Particle Auth Core, an alternative to Particle Auth (`Particle`).
- `EvmPrivateKey`, custom EVM wallet imports/exports.
- `SolanaPrivateKey`, custom Solana wallet imports/exports.
- `MetaMask`.
- `Rainbow`.
- `Trust`.
- `ImToken`.
- `BitKeep`.
- `WalletConnect`.
- `Phantom`, intended for Solana.
- `Zerion`.
- `Math`.
- `Inch1`, 1inch.
- `Zengo`.
- `Alpha`.
- `OKX`.
- `TokenPocket`, not supported by iOS.

If you're using `Particle`, you'll also need to pass in a `ConnectConfig` object containing:

- `LoginType`, the specific login to be prompted, is an enum with the following choices:
  - `EMAIL`.
  - `PHONE`.
  - `FACEBOOK`.
  - `APPLE`.
  - `TWITTER`.
  - `DISCORD`.
  - `GITHUB`.
  - `TWITCH`.
  - `MICROSOFT`.
  - `LINKEDIN`.
  - `JWT`.
- `account`, if you're expecting a specific JWT, email, or phone (required for JWT).
- `SupportLoginType`, the different authentication types to be supported by the popup modal.
  - enum with all of the above choices for `LoginType`, except `JWT` , including `ALL`.
- `SocialLoginPrompt`, whether or not the social login popup will be in "form mode" (simplified, minimal UI) or not. By default, set to `false`.
- `LoginAuthorization`, a string (hex for EVM, base58 for Solana) to be prompted for signature upon login as authorization. Optional.

E.g.:

```csharp C#
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect(this._walletType);

ConnectConfig config = new ConnectConfig(LoginType.PHONE, null, SupportAuthType.ALL, false);
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect(WalletType.Particle, config);
```

### Disconnect Wallet

To disconnect an active session, identified by a specific address, you can call `ParticleConnect.Instance.Disconnect`, passing in the specific wallet type (`WalletType` object) and associated address that you'd like to disconnect from your application, as is shown below.

```csharp C#
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Disconnect(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```

### Is Connected

Another important method is `IsConnected`, returning a Boolean indicating whether or not a user (or, in this case, an address and `WalletType`) are currently connected to your application. This can be called through `ParticleConnectInteraction.IsConnected`. E.g.:

```csharp C#
ParticleConnectInteraction.IsConnected(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

`ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAndSendTransaction` acts as the primary mechanism for both EVM and Solana for sending (or, in this case, suggesting) transactions. Upon calling, the `WalletType` (the adapter in question) will return a confirmation popup requesting a signature from the user before sending the transaction directly to the network. `SignAndSendTransaction` takes three parameters:

- `WalletType`, the type of wallet being used.
- `address`, the public address being used.
- `transaction`, a stringified representation of a transaction object.

E.g.:

```csharp C#
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAndSendTransaction(this._walletType, publicAddress, transaction);
```

### Sign Transaction

`ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. This will behave similarly to `SignAndSendTransaction`, although it will only function on either the `Phantom` or `SolanaPrivateKey` wallet types and will purely return a signature.

The plural of this method is `ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAllTransactions`, taking a list of transactions to be prompted for signature, rather than just one.

```csharp C#
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTransaction(this._walletType, publicAddress, transaction);

// Alternatively
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAllTransactions(this._walletType, publicAddress, transactions);
```

### Sign Message

A simple message (UTF-8 string) can be signed on both EVM & Solana through `ParticleConnect.Instance.SignMessage`, passing in the `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress` in this example), and the `message` in question. `message` should be a general string to be signed. E.g.:

```csharp C#
var message = "GM, Particle!";
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignMessage(this._walletType, publicAddress, message);
```

### Sign Typed Data

As an alternative to `SignMessage`, for **EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. To do this, you can use `adapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData`, represented as either `TypedDataV4`, `TypedDataV2`, or `TypedDataV1`). This takes the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `data`, the typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](ref:auth-web) page for additional guidance.

E.g.:

```csharp C#
var txtAsset = Resources.Load<TextAsset>("TypedDataV4");
string typedData = txtAsset.text;

await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTypedData(this._walletType, publicAddress, typedData);
```

### Import Wallet

If you're using the`EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey` wallet types, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. These can be achieved through either `ImportWalletFromPrivateKey` for importing a private key, or `ImportWalletFromMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase). Both of these methods require both the `WalletType` (either `EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey`) and the private key/seed phrase to be imported.

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `ParticleConnect.Instance.ExportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

```csharp C#
await ParticleConnect.Instance.ImportWalletFromPrivateKey(this._walletType, privateKey);
  
await ParticleConnect.Instance.ImportWalletFromMnemonic(this._walletType, mnemonic);

// Exportation
await ParticleConnect.Instance.ExportWalletPrivateKey(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```
