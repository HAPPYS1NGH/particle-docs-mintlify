## Particle Connect for iOS

The utilization of Particle Connect within iOS applications enables simultaneous Web2-like onboarding and Web3-native onboarding, acting as a sort of "SSO for Web3," aggregating multiple onboarding paths within a single custom, in-house connection modal. These paths include Web3 accounts (social logins), Web3 wallets (through WalletConnect and Solana's `wallet-adapter`), and private key imports. Thus, Particle Connect on iOS aims to facilitate a universally accessible entry into mobile dApps.

Leveraging Particle Connect within your iOS application is relatively straightforward, as **outlined below**.

## Repository

Before diving into the configuration and utilization process, if you'd like to look at our demo repository for an initial understanding of the underlying architecture and implementation flow, the official Particle Connect iOS SDK repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-ios).

<Warning>
It is strongly discouraged to use a private key or the mnemonic import/generate function. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself, as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The setup process on iOS can be somewhat lengthy, so to ensure you don't run into any compatibility issues and can get started as soon as possible, you'll need to confirm that your project meets several different prerequisites:

- **Xcode 15.0** or higher
- **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher
- **iOS 14** or higher

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Additionally, before diving in, you'll need to retrieve three universally required values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These directly link your project (instance of Particle Connect) with the Particle dashboard to enable customization, analytics, tracking, etc. To find these values, follow the below process:

1. Sign up/log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>

2. Create a new project or enter an existing project.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

3. Create a new iOS application, or skip this step if you already have one.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/ios.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/ios.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

4. Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>

### Dependencies

Particle Connect requires numerous dependencies you must declare within your Podfile. To do this, you'll need to start by ensuring that you have a Podfile made. This is where you'll determine the pods (packages) to be used within your application.

If you don't have a Podfile made, head over to the root of your project directly and run the following:

```shell Terminal
pod init
```

Then, within your Podfile, you'll need to throw in a few different dependencies, the specifics of which depend on the functions of Particle Connect that you'd like to use.

1. Regardless of specific functions, you'll need `ConnectCommon` and `ParticleConnect`, alongside `AuthCoreAdapter`. Optionally, if you'd like to use Particle Auth instead, you can use `ParticleAuthAdapter`.
2. If you'd like to support importing (or generating fresh) wallets on EVM chains, you'll need `ConnectEVMAdapter`.
   1. To do the same on Solana, you can use `ConnectSolanaAdapter`.
3. To support connection with Phantom (on Solana), you'll need to use `ConnectPhantomAdapter`
4. For general WalletConnect-based connection, you can use `ConnectWalletConnectAdapter`:

```ruby
pod 'ConnectCommon'
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter'
pod 'ConnectEVMAdapter' 
pod 'ConnectSolanaAdapter'
pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter'
pod 'AuthCoreAdapter' 

# Alternatively, to use ParticleAuthService (deprecated) 
# pod 'ParticleAuthAdapter' 
```

With this set, you can simply run the following command to ensure changes are saved:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update
open your-project.xcworkspace
```

Before continuing, paste the following code into your Podfile, if not already present; this is required for utilizing Particle Connect. You'll encounter issues otherwise.

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      end
    end
end
```

### Configuration

Now that you've retrieved your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` from the Particle dashboard, and also set up your Podfile, it's time to move onto the core configuration of your project before diving into examples of utilization. To begin this process, you'll need to configure a `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file.

Since it's ikely not already present, head to the root of your project and make a blank file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`

Within this file, you must enter the authentication credentials retrieved from the Particle dashboard. You can do this through the structure below:

```xml XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Additionally, head over to your `UIApplicationDelegate`. Here, you'll need to import the various libraries previously declared within your Podfile at the top of the file. An example of this can be seen below:

```swift Swift
import ConnectCommon
import ConnectEVMAdapter
import ConnectPhantomAdapter
import ConnectSolanaAdapter
import ConnectWalletConnectAdapter
import ParticleNetworkBase
import ParticleConnect
import AuthCoreAdapter

// Alternatively, to use ParticleAuthService (deprecated) 
// import ParticleAuthAdapter
```

### Initialization

Now that these are set, you'll need to initialize Particle Connect itself (within `UIApplicationDelegate`). Particle Connect won't function until initialization is complete (and valid). Essentially, initialization involves the declaration of specific imported adapters, alongside the chain to be used and application metadata.

Specifically, `ParticleConnect.initialize` takes the following parameters:

- `env`, the environment (production, debug, etc.) in which Particle Connect will be initialized (in this example, it's set to `.debug`).
- `chainInfo`, the primary chain to be used within your application. This should be dictated by an overall blockchain, followed by a specific network (testnet). Within this example, it's `.ethereum`(alternatively it could be `.ethereumGoerli`, and so on.)
- `dAppData`, metadata outlining the description of your application. This should be an instance of `DAppMetadata` with the following parameters:
  - `name`, the name of your project.
  - `icon`, a URL linking to the icon of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally.
  - `url`, the URL of your project's website.
- Finally, within the body of `initialize`, you'll need to pass in a list of adapters to be offered within the connection modal. This can be defined as a simple array containing various imported adapters (such as `ParticleAuthAdapter`, `WalletConnectAdapter`, etc.)

An **example** of initialization can be found below.

```swift Swift
var adapters: [ConnectAdapter] = [
       AuthCoreAdaper(),
       WalletConnectAdapter(),
       MetaMaskConnectAdapter(),
       PhantomConnectAdapter(),
       EVMConnectAdapter(),
       SolanaConnectAdapter(),
       ImtokenConnectAdapter(),
       BitkeepConnectAdapter(),
       RainbowConnectAdapter(),
       TrustConnectAdapter(),
		   ZerionConnectAdapter(),
       MathConnectAdapter(),
       Inch1ConnectAdapter(),
       ZengoConnectAdapter(),
       AlphaConnectAdapter(),
       OKXConnectAdapter(),
   
       // Alternativell, to use ParticleAuthService (deprecated) 
       // ParticleAuthAdapter()
       ]
 
ParticleConnect.initialize(env: .debug,  
 chainInfo: .ethereum,  
 dAppData: DAppMetaData(name: "Particle Connect",  
 icon: URL(string: "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png")!,  
 url: URL(string: "https://connect.particle.network")!)) {
      adapters
}
```

### Scheme Configuration

The final step in setting up your iOS project is the configuration of a scheme URL and `LSAApplicationQueriesSchemes` within your application. Beginning with the scheme URL, add the following to your dApp's `application(\_:open:options:)` method:

```swift Swift
return ParticleConnect.handleUrl(url)
```

From there, you'll need to configure the scheme URL itself; select your application target within the "Info" section, then add an additional URL type, and finally include the scheme. **This scheme should be `pn` added to your `appId`.**

For example, if your `appId` is `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f` --simply adding `pn` to the beginning of the `appId`.

With the scheme URL configured, you'll also need to head into `info.plist` and add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` according to your specific utilization of Web3 wallets (not Particle Auth, but independent wallet adapters). An example of this can be seen below (each of these is optional and dependent upon your given implementation)

```xml XML
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
	<string>metamask</string>
	<string>phantom</string>
	<string>bitkeep</string>
	<string>imtokenv2</string>
	<string>rainbow</string>
	<string>trust</string>
	
	<string>zerion</string>
  <string>mathwallet</string>
  <string>1inch</string>
  <string>awallet</string>
  <string>okex</string>
</array>
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Utilization of WalletConnect V2

If you're planning on using WalletConnect V2 as your primary method of connection for traditional Web3 wallets, you'll need to use the `setWalletConnectV2ProjectId` method on `ParticleConnect`, passing in your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com). Additionally, you can set specific chains to be used within WalletConnect (`chainInfo` structures) with `setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. An example of this can be found below.

```swift Swift
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2ProjectId("WalletConnect V2 Project ID")

ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos([.ethereum, .ethereumGoerli])
```

### Get all Wallet Adapter

To retrieve all wallet adapters either in total, by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`), or by address, you'll need to call one of the following methods:

- `ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters`, returns all adapters (for every address and `chainType`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapters`, retrieves adapters by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress`, returns all adapters associated with a specific (user) public address.

```swift Swift
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters()
            .filter { $0.walletType == .authCore }.first

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapters(chainType: .evm)

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress(publicAddress: address)
```

### Get Adapter Accounts

`adapter.getAccounts` returns a list of accounts associated/connected with a specific adapter. `adapter` is an instance of a given wallet adapter, such as `ParticleAuthAdapter`. Each adapter has a `getAccounts` method by default. Alternatively, to retrieve smart accounts associated with a given adapter, you'll need to call `adapter.getSmartAccounts`. E.g.:

```swift Swift
let accounts = adapter.getAccounts()

// Alternatively
let smartAccounts = try await adapter.getSmartAccounts()
```

### Switch Chain

Oftentimes, the primary chain initially set through `initialize` won't be the _only_ chain used within your application; thus, to account for this and change the primary chain post-initialization, you can call `ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo`, passing in a `chainInfo` object, as shown in the example below.

`WalletType.authCore` comes from Particle Auth Core and `WalletType.particle` comes from Particle Auth Service (deprecated), both of them support evm and solana, if you need switch chain for there two account, and have switch from solana to evm or evm to solana, you can call `(adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain`.

```swift Swift
ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo(.ethereum)

// switch chain asynchronous from evm to solana or solana to evm.
// make sure the adapter.walletType is authCore or particle.
let result = try await (adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain(.ethereum).value
```

### Connect Wallet

Likely one of the most important methods, specific adapters can initiate connection (through an initialization in a variable such as `adapter`) with the `connect` method. Depending on the specific adapter, this method will throw a modal facilitating connection. 

For `EVMConnectAdapter` and `SolanaConnectAdapter`, this will generate a fresh account (public and private key pair). Otherwise, the specific connection flow will be dependent upon the adapter in which `connect` is called. E.g.:

```swift Swift
adapter.connect().subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let account):
      print(account)
  }.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Disconnect Wallet

Alternatively, if a user has already connected their wallet, you'll be able to use `disconnect` as the primary method to disconnect a user within an active session. This will be relatively universal across adapters. E.g.:

```swift Swift
adapter.disconnect(address).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let success):
      print(success)
  }.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Is Connected

Another quite important method is `isConnected`, returning a Boolean based on whether or not a given session (user) is currently connected to a wallet (through the specific adapter instance). `adapter.isConnected` takes a given public address and returns `true` or `false` depending on it's connection status. E.g.:

```swift Swift
let result = adapter.isConnected(publicAddress: address)
```

### Import Wallet

If you're using `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter`, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. These can be achieved through either `importWalletFromPrivateKey` for importing a private key, or `importWalletFromMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase).

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

<Note>
<p>This is not the import/export of wallets within Particle Auth; Particle Network's MPC-TSS accounts do not support importing or exporting private keys.</p>
<p>This is specific to custom account connection with Particle Connect.</p>
</Note>

```swift Swift
adapter.importWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let account):
      print(account)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)

adapter.importWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let account):
      print(account)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)

// Exportation
adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey(publicAddress: address).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let privateKey):
      print(privateKey)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

To initiate a transaction for signature and ultimately settlement on-chain, you'll need to use `adapter.signAndSendTransaction` (for both EVM & Solana)- this acts as the primary method of sending transactions through Particle Connect. Calling this method will return a popup to the adapter in question, prompting a signature from the end user. Once confirmation is given, the transaction will be immediately sent to the network.

`adapter.signAndSendTransaction` takes the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for transaction initiation.
- `transaction`, a stringified transaction object (containing fields like 'to', 'from', 'value', 'data', etc.)

E.g.:

```swift Swift
adapter.signAndSendTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let signature):
      print(signature)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Sign Transaction

`adapter.signTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. Specifically, this method requires the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `transaction`, a base58 string representing a transaction object.

This will return a popup requesting confirmation to either `SolanaConnectAdapter` or `PhantomConnectAdapter` depending on which you've defined as `adapter` (or, alternatively, a custom adapter you've set up). E.g.:

```swift Swift
adapter.signTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let signed):
      print(signed)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)

// Alternatively, the plural form of this method, takes a list of transactions
adapter.signAllTransactions(publicAddress: address, transactions: transactions).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let signed):
      print(signed)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Sign Message

To sign a basic UTF-8 message (string), you can use `adapter.signMessage` to prompt the user for a signature, alongside the message in question. `adapter.signMessage` takes the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `message`, the message you'd like the user to sign; for EVM, this should be a hex-encoded string (prefixed by '0x'), while for Solana, you can pass in a standard string (no encoding needed).

E.g.:

```swift Swift
adapter.signMessage(publicAddress: address, message: message).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let signed):
      print(signed)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Sign Typed Data

As an alternative to `signMessage`, for **EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. To do this, you can use `adapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData` V4). This takes the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `data`, the typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance.

E.g.:

```swift Swift
connectAdapter.signTypedData(publicAddress: address, data: data).subscribe { [weak self] result in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  switch result {
      case .failure(let error):
      print(error)
      case .success(let signed):
      print(signed)
  }
}.disposed(by: bag)
```

### Custom WalletConnect Adapter

There may be cases where the existing selection of adapters doesn't include a wallet you'd like to be featured within Particle Connect. In this situation, creating a custom adapter (using `WalletConnectAdapter` as the parent class) is quite simple. Doing so will require a structure similar to the example below, in which a custom Coin98 adapter is made by overriding `walletType` with a custom `AdapterInfo` instance.

```swift Swift
public class Coin98WalletConnectAdapter: WalletConnectAdapter {
  public override var walletType: WalletType {
      return WalletType.custom(info: AdapterInfo.init(name: "Coin98",
                   url: "https://coin98.com/",
                   icon: "https://registry.walletconnect.com/v2/logo/md/dee547be-936a-4c92-9e3f-7a2350a62e00",
                   redirectUrlHost: "coin98",
                   supportChains: [.evm],
                   deepLink: "coin98://", // Requires either universal link or scheme
                   scheme: "coin98://"))
  }
}
```
