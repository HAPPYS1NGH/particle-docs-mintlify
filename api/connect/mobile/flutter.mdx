## Particle Connect for Flutter

The Particle Connect Flutter SDK facilitates end-to-end integration of Particle Connect within applications built using Flutter on either iOS or Android. Particle Connect acts as the "SSO for Web3," aggregating authentication mechanisms from both Web2 (through MPC-TSS social logins) and Web3 (through traditional wallets with WalletConnect, Solana's `wallet-adapter`, and private key imports), thus reducing the barrier to entry within your application.

Instructions and examples for implementing Particle Connect within Flutter applications **can be found below**.

## Repository

The Particle Connect Flutter SDK is also largely open-source through the[ `particle-flutter` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter). Before diving into the setup process below, it may help to build some context by diving into the underlying architecture and demos provided within [this repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter).

<Warning>
It is strongly discouraged to use a private key or the mnemonic import/generate function. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself, as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

Configuring and setting up the Particle Connect Flutter SDK is relatively standard, although it differs significantly based on whether you're using Flutter on Android or iOS. However, for both platforms, the setup should be complete in just few minutes.

To begin, regardless of your platform, you must head over to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network) and retrieve your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

1. Sign up/log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
</div>

2. Create a new project or enter an existing project.

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
</div>

3. Create a new web application, or skip this step if you already have one.

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network app."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network app."
/>
</div>

4. Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`).

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
</div>


### Adding the Particle Connect Flutter SDK to your application

Additionally, regardless of platform, you'll need to add `particle_connect` to your Flutter application. This is a requirement before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
flutter pub add particle_connect
```

### Android configuration

To configure Particle Connect and prepare for utilization, you can begin by going ahead and opening your `build.gradle` file, often found at the following file path: `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`

Within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to add four new lines to ensure Particle Connect runs properly:

1. `minSdkVersion`. In most cases, this will be set to `23`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
defaultConfig {
  applicationId "com.example.particle_auth_test"

  minSdkVersion 23 // Required
  targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
  versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
  versionName flutterVersionName

  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
}
```

Additionally, staying within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to ensure that you're using version 11 of Java in both `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`, alongside enabling `dataBinding`.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

kotlinOptions {
  jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_11 
}

dataBinding {
  enabled = true
}
```

***

### iOS configuration

Before beginning, ensure your project meets the following prerequisites:

- **Xcode 15.0** or later.

- **iOS 14** or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `ios/{project name}.xcworkspace`. 

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` . Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

From here, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY`, and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Next, you'll need to head over to your `AppDelegate.swift` file to add an import of `ParticleConnect`.

```swift
import ParticleConnect
```

Within your application's `application` method (as shown below), you'll need to include a handler condition derived from `ParticleConnect.handleUrl`. This should be as simple as a `true` return upon a truthy value of `ParticleConnect.handleUrl`, and a `super.application(app, open: url, options: options)` return upon a falsy value. 

```swift
override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
  if ParticleConnect.handleUrl(url) {
      return true
  } else {
      return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
  }
}
```

Wrapping up, you'll need to configure your application's scheme URL. To configure this, select your application from "TARGETS" under the "Info" section, then click "+" to add a URL type.

This should simply be set to "pn" + your `projectId` (retrieved and configured prior), resulting in a scheme URL that looks like the following:

```text
pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f
```

Additionally, head over to your `Info.plist` file and include the following snippet:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>imtokenv2</string>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>phantom</string>
  <string>bitkeep</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <string>zerion</string>
  <string>mathwallet</string>
  <string>1inch</string>
  <string>awallet</string>
  <string>okex</string>
</array>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
```

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_connect` is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://pub.dev/packages/particle_connect/install) to complete this if you haven't already.

## Examples of Utilization

### Initialization

Now that you've spun up a project on the [Particle dashboard](<>) and configured your application, you're ready to move on to the initialization of the SDK itself. This must happen before the other methods become functional. To begin, you'll need to call `ParticleInfo.set`, passing in your `projectId` and client key (`clientK`). Next, initialization can happen through the `init` function on `ParticleConnect`, which can be imported from `package:particle_connect/particle_connect.dart`. `init` takes the following parameters:

- `chainInfo`, a `ChainInfo` object representing the primary chain that you'd like to be used within Particle Connect.
- `dappInfo`, a `DappMetaData` object representing key information about your project, such as:
  - `walletConnectProjectId`, your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).
  - `name`, the name of your project.
  - `icon`, the logo of your project, ideally in 512x512.
  - `url`, the URL for your project's website.
  - `description`, a short description of your project.
- `env`, the environment in which Particle Connect will be used, either:
  - `Env.dev`.
  - `Env.staging`.
  - `Env.production`.

Additionally, if you'd like to define multiple chains to be available through WalletConnect, you'll need to create an array of `ChainInfo` objects (`chainInfos` in this example) and use it within `ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. E.g.:

```dart Dart
ParticleInfo.set(projectId, clientK);

final dappInfo = DappMetaData(
    "WalletConnect project id",
    "Particle Connect",
    "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
    "https://connect.particle.network",
    "Particle Connect Flutter Demo");
ParticleConnect.init(chainInfo, dappInfo, Env.dev);

List<ChainInfo> chainInfos = <ChainInfo>[ChainInfo.Ethereum, ChainInfo.Polygon];
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos(chainInfos);
```

### Connect

Acting as the primary method of returning a connection menu for a specific `WalletType`, the `connect` method on `ParticleConnect` will be the main mechanism for wallet connection within the Particle Connect SDK. `ParticleConnect.connect` takes one parameter, the `WalletType` to be requested for connection. Upon calling, the wallet specified in this field will throw an interface initiating the connection. 

`WalletType` is an `enum` containing the following:

- `particle`, social logins through Particle Auth.
- `evmPrivateKey`, custom EVM wallet imports/exports.
- `solanaPrivateKey`, custom Solana wallet imports/exports.
- `metaMask`.
- `rainbow`.
- `trust`.
- `imToken`.
- `bitKeep`.
- `walletConnect`.
- `phantom`, intended for Solana.
- `zerion`.
- `math`.
- `zengo`.
- `alpha`.
- `okx`.

If you're using `Particle`, you'll also need to pass in a `ParticleConnectConfig` object containing:

- `LoginType`, the specific login to be prompted; enum with the following choices:
  - `email`.
  - `phone`.
  - `facebook`.
  - `apple`.
  - `twitter`.
  - `discord`.
  - `github`.
  - `twitch`.
  - `microsoft`.
  - `linkedin`.
  - `jwt`.
- `account`, if you're expecting a specific JWT, email, or phone (required for JWT).
- `SupportAuthType`, the different authentication types to be supported by the popup modal; this should be wrapped in an array.
  - `enum` with all of the above choices for `LoginType`, except `jwt`.
- `SocialLoginPrompt`, an enum dictating the type of social login prompt to be thrown, either:
  - `select_account`.
  - `consent`.
  - `none`.
- `LoginAuthorization`, a string (hex for EVM, base58 for Solana) to be prompted for signature upon login as authorization (optional.)

E.g:

```dart Dart
final result = await ParticleConnect.connect(WalletType.particle);
```

### Disconnect

Once a user has been connected, entering an active session, you'll have the ability to disconnect them from your application programmatically through `ParticleConnect.disconnect`, which requires a targeted `WalletType` and `address` (`publicAddress` in this case). This pair dictates the specific session (user) to be disconnected. E.g.:

```dart Dart
String result = await ParticleConnect.disconnect(WalletType.particle, publicAddress);
```

### Is Connected

Another common method is `ParticleConnect.isConnected`, returning a Boolean representing whether or not a user (defined by a paired `WalletType` and `address`) is currently connected to your application. E.g.:

```dart Dart
bool result = await ParticleConnect.isConnected(WalletType.particle, publicAddress);
```

### Sign Message

A simple message (UTF-8 string) can be signed on both EVM & Solana through `ParticleConnect.signMessage`, passing in the `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress` in this example), and the `message` in question. `message` should either be a hex-encoded string for EVM, or a base58 string for Solana. E.g.:

```dart Dart
String result = await ParticleConnect.signMessage(WalletType.particle, publicAddress, message);
```

### Sign Transaction

For **Solana**, as an alternative to `signAndSendTransaction`, you can sign a given transaction without pushing it to the network with `ParticleConnect.signTransaction`, taking `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress`), and a base58 `transaction` string representing a structured transaction object.

Alternatively, the plural of this method is `ParticleConnect.signAllTransactions`, which instead takes an array of base58 `transaction` strings to be prompted for signature.

```dart Dart
String result = await ParticleConnect.signTransaction(WalletType.particle, publicAddress, transaction);

// Plural
String result = await ParticleConnect.signAllTransactions(WalletType.particle, publicAddress, transactions);
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

Used as the primary mechanism of sending transactions, `ParticleConnect.signAndSendTransaction` takes in a transaction and prompts a user (through a UI corresponding with `WalletType`) for confirmation/signature. Specifically, `ParticleConnect.signAndSendTransaction` takes a `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress`), and `transaction` string. For EVM chains, this should be a hex-encoded stringor Solana, this should be a base58 string. An example of this can be found below.

```dart Dart
String result = await ParticleConnect.signAndSendTransaction(WalletType.particle, publicAddress, transaction);
```

### Sign Typed Data

Additionally, for **EVM chains**, if standard UTF-8 string signatures aren't enough, you can use `ParticleConnect.signTypedData` to prompt signature of typed (structured) data, adjacent to `eth_signTypedData`. `ParticleConnect.signTypedData` requires `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress`), and the `typedData` to be signed. `typedData` should be a hex-encoded string representing a data structure. E.g.:

```dart Dart
String result = await ParticleConnect.signTypedData(walletType, publicAddress, typedDataHex);
```

### Import Wallet

If you're using `evmPrivateKey` or `solanaPrivateKey` wallet types, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. These can be achieved through either `importPrivateKey` for importing a private key, or `importMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase). Both of these methods require both the `WalletType` (either `evmPrivateKey` or `solanaPrivateKey`) and the private key/seed phrase to be imported.

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `ParticleConnect.exportPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `evmPrivateKey` or `solanaPrivateKey` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

```dart Dart
await ParticleConnect.importPrivateKey(WalletType.evmPrivateKey, privateKey);

await ParticleConnect.importMnemonic(WalletType.evmPrivateKey, mnemonic);

// Exportation
await ParticleConnect.exportPrivateKey(WalletType.evmPrivateKey, publicAddress);
```
