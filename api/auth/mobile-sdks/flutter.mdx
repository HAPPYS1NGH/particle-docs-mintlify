## Particle Auth for Flutter

The Particle Auth Flutter SDK enables full stack integration of Particle Auth into applications built on Flutter. This includes everything from the initial configuration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service to specific interactions. Specifically in this case, Flutter can be leveraged in either Android or iOS environments, both to the same degree. This is done primarily through Dart.

Platform-specific configuration instructions, alongside examples of utilization, can be found below.

## Getting Started

Interaction with the Particle Auth Flutter SDK is quite standard and in line with other Particle Auth SDKs, although the key deviations can be found within the configuration process. The configuration process of this SDK differs significantly based on whether you're using Flutter on Android or iOS. 

To begin, you'll need to head over to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network) and retrieve your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

1. Sign up/log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
</div>

2. Create a new project or enter an existing project.

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
</div>

3. Create a new web application, or skip this step if you already have one.

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network app."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network app."
/>
</div>

4. Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`).

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
</div>

### Adding the Particle Auth Flutter SDK to your application

Additionally, regardless of platform, you'll need to begin by adding `particle_auth_core` to your Flutter application; this is a requirement before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
flutter pub add particle_auth_core 

// Alternatively, to use Auth (deprecated)
// flutter pub add particle_auth
```

### Android configuration

If you're building an Android application with Flutter, you must follow the steps below to configure Particle Auth. To begin, you'll need to go ahead and open your `build.gradle` file, often found at the following file path: `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`

Within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to add four new lines to ensure Particle Auth runs appropriately:

1. `minSdkVersion`, which in most cases will be set to `23`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
defaultConfig {
  applicationId "com.example.particle_auth_test"

  minSdkVersion 23 // Required by Particle Auth
  targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
  versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
  versionName flutterVersionName

  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
}
```

Staying within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to ensure that you're using version 11 of Java in both `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`, alongside enabling `dataBinding`.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

kotlinOptions {
  jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_11 
}

dataBinding {
  enabled = true
}
```

Finally, for dependency management, within `build.gradle` you'll need to ensure that the `repositories` object in both `buildscript` and `allprojects` has `maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }` present, such as is shown below.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
buildscript {
  ...
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }

  dependencies {
      ...
  }
}


allprojects {
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }
}

...

```

***

### iOS configuration

If you're building an iOS application with Flutter, this also entails a unique and iOS-specific configuration process. Before beginning, ensure your project meets the following prerequisites:

- Xcode 15.0 or later.

- iOS 14 or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `apps/{project name}.xcworkspace`. 

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

Now, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY`, and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Alternatively, to use Auth (deprecated), two more steps.

You'll need to head over to your `AppDelegate.swift` file to add an import of `ParticleAuthService`.

```swift Swift
import ParticleAuthService
```

Additionally, within your application's `application` method (as shown below), you'll need to include a handler condition derived from `ParticleAuthService.handleUrl`. This should be as simple as a `true` return upon a truthy value of `ParticleAuthService.handleUrl`, and a `super.application(app, open: url, options: options)` return upon a falsy value. 

```swift Swift
override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
  if ParticleAuthService.handleUrl(url) {
      return true
  } else {
      return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
  }
}
```

Wrapping up, you'll need to configure your application's scheme URL. To configure this, select your application from "TARGETS" under the "Info" section, then click "+" to add a URL type.

This should simply be set to "pn" + your `projectId` (retrieved and configured prior), resulting in a scheme URL that looks something like the following:

```text
pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f
```

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_auth` is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://pub.dev/packages/particle_auth/install) to complete this, if you haven't already.

<Note>
<p>Another important note before continuing.</p>
<p>Our SDK is a static library (XCFramework). When using the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, you'll need to specify that you're using a static framework through the following:</p>
<p>
```
 target 'Runner' do
   use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
   # user particle_auth_core
   pod "Thresh
   pod "ParticleMPCCore"
   pod "ParticleAuthCore"
   pod "AuthCoreAdapter"
 
   pod 'ParticleAuthService'
   pod 'ParticleNetworkBase'
   pod 'ConnectCommon'
 
 	# Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
 	# pod 'ParticleAuthService'
   # pod 'ParticleNetworkBase'
  end
```
</p>
</Note>

## Examples of utilization

### Initialization

Before using the full extent of the SDK, you'll need to initialize it with `init`, passing in specific chain in which you intend to primary onboard to within Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service. This is represented as an object containing chain info (often derived from `ChainInfo.{Chain}`).

```dart Dart
// set the project info, get it from dashboard.
ParticleInfo.set(projectId, clientKey);

// inititilze ParticleAuth and ParticleAuthCore.
ParticleAuth.init(ChainInfo.Ethereum, env);
ParticleAuthCore.init()
```

### Login

Now that you've installed, configured, and initialized Particle Auth, you'll need to initiate a login and throw a social login prompt for a user to authenticate through. Post-login (through the menu obtained via the login), a user will have an account generated, thus unlocking the remaining SDK methods for interaction.

This is achieved and configured through `ParticleAuthCore.connect` or `ParticleAuth.login`(deprecated) . Once this method is called, the corresponding login popup will be thrown by requesting user authentication before returning to the application in a signed-in state.

`ParticleAuth.login` takes the following parameters:

- `loginType`, the mechanism of social login to be thrown; such as email, Google, Twitter, etc:
- `LoginType.email`
- `LoginType.phone`
- `LoginType.google`
- `LoginType.facebook`
- `LoginType.apple`
- `LoginType.twitter`
- `LoginType.discord`
- `LoginType.github`
- `LoginType.twitch`
- `LoginType.microsoft`
- `LoginType.linkedin`
- `LoginType.jwt`
- `account`, for predetermined/expected phone numbers or emails. This can be optimally used if you're using custom authentication with JWTs. It is also a required field with the expected JWT in question.
- `supportAuthTypes`, the authentication types to be supported/shown in the authentication popup. The types listed here will be available as additional buttons in the generalized popup that shows within email- and phone-based logins, such as:
  - `SupportAuthType.apple`
  - `SupportAuthType.google`
  - `SupportAuthType.facebook`
  - `SupportAuthType.discord`
  - `SupportAuthType.github`
  - `SupportAuthType.twitch`
  - `SupportAuthType.microsoft`
  - `SupportAuthType.linkedin`
  - `SupportAuthType.phone`
  - `SupportAuthType.email`
  - `SupportAuthType.twitter`
- `authorization`, an optional field in which a message can be passed for signature for added authorization.

```dart Dart
List<SupportAuthType> supportAuthType = <SupportAuthType>[];
supportAuthType.add(SupportAuthType.all);

ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.google, prompt: SocialLoginPrompt.select_account);

ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.email, supportAuthTypes: SupportAuthType.values, prompt: SocialLoginPrompt.select_account);
  
// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)

// Optional
final authorization = LoginAuthorization(messageHex, true);

ParticleAuth.login(
  LoginType.phone,
  "",
  supportAuthType,
  socialLoginPrompt,
  authorization
);
```

### Is Login

There may be scenarios in which knowing whether a current session (a user) is currently logged in with Particle Auth or not is important. This is achieved through `ParticleAuthCore.isConnected` (server-side check), in `particle_auth`, which is deprecated, this is achieved through either `ParticleAuth.isLogin` (local check) or `ParticleAuth.isLoginAsync` (server-side check). These methods will return a Boolean based on the login state of the session in question.

```dart Dart
await ParticleAuthCore.isConnected();


  
// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
await ParticleAuth.isLogin();

await ParticleAuth.isLoginAsync();
```

### Logout

To exit an existing session (logging a user out), you can simply call `ParticleAuthCore.disconnect` . Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can simply call `ParticleAuth.fastLogout`or `ParticleAuth.logout`.

```dart Dart
awiat ParticleAuthCore.disconnect();

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
await ParticleAuth.fastLogout();
```

### Get Address

To retrieve the address, you can call `Evm.getAddress` or `Solana.getAddress`. 

Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.getAddress`, (EVM or Solana, depending on the active chain determined in prior initialization)  retrieve the address of a given user/active session,

```dart Dart
final address = await Evm.getAddress();
final address = await Solana.getAddress();

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
final address = await ParticleAuth.getAddress();
```

### Sign Message

To throw a standard message for signature (meaning a user will be prompted in-UI to sign a given string), you can call `Evm.personalSign`,  This method on EVM requires a hexadecimal string, as shown below. Otherwise, on Solana, you can pass in a UTF-8/readable string.

Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.signMessage`.

```dart Dart
final messageHex = "0x${StringUtils.toHexString("Hello Particle")}";
String signature = await Evm.personalSign(messageHex);
String signature = await Evm.personalSignUnique(messageHex);

const message = "Hello Particle";
final signature = await Solana.signMessage(message);


// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
String signature = await ParticleAuth.signMessage(messageHex);
String signature = await ParticleAuth.signMessageUnique(messageHex);
```

### Sign Transaction

This is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without sending it. Similar to message signing, this will prompt a signature in-UI with details about the transaction. Programmatically, the proposed transaction should be formatted as a (converted to a) base58 string. Passing in an object directly will not work in this case. 

```dart Dart
final signature = await Solana.signTransaction(transaction);

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
final signature = await ParticleAuth.signTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign All Transactions

Following the aforementioned method, you can use `Solana.signAllTransactions` to propose a collection of **Solana** transactions for signature, rather than just a single transaction.

Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.signAllTransactions` .

```dart Dart

List<String> signatures = await Solana.signAllTransactions(transactions);

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
List<String> signatures = await ParticleAuth.signAllTransactions(transactions);
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

For more generalized transaction sending, `Evm.sendTransaction`and `Solana.signAndSendTransaction` will be the primary method used in virtually every scenario. This will propose a signature (on both EVM and Solana), and then immediately push it to the network once confirmed. For EVM, the transaction passed into `ParticleAuth.signAndSendTransaction` will need to be a hexadecimal string, while Solana requires a base58 string.

Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.signAndSendTransaction`.

```dart Dart
final signature = await Evm.sendTransaction(transaction);
final signature = await Solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
final signature = await ParticleAuth.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign Typed Data

`Evm.signTypedData` is an **EVM-specific** method for signing structured (typed) data. For more information on `signTypedData`, see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page.

Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.signTypedData`.

```dart Dart
// your typed data is a json string
String typedDataHex = "0x${StringUtils.toHexString(typedData)}";

String signature = await Evm.signTypedData(typedDataHex);
String signature = await Evm.signTypedDataUnique(typedDataHex);

// Alternatively, to use particle_auth (deprecated)
String result =
        await ParticleAuth.signTypedData(typedDataHex, SignTypedDataVersion.v4);
```

### Set Chain Info

If you'd like to set the chain being utilized (after initially defining this in `init`), you can call either `ParticleAuth.setChainInfo` (synchronous) or ` ParticleAuthCore.switchChain` (asynchronous),`ParticleAuth.setChainInfoAsync` (asynchronous) and pass in a chain information object, often derived from `{Chain}.{network}()` or `ChainInfo.{Chain}`.

```dart Dart
await ParticleAuth.setChainInfo(ChainInfo.EthereumGoerli);

await ParticleAuthCore.switchChain(ChainInfo.PolygonMumbai);


// Alternatively,  to use particle_auth (deprecated)
await ParticleAuth.setChainInfoAsync(ChainInfo.EthereumGoerli);
```

### Get Chain Info

For the retrieval of the currently selected (primary) chain within an active session, you'll need to call `ParticleAuth.getChainInfo`. This returns a ChainInfo object containing:

- `name`, the name of the chain in question (ex: Ethereum).
- `id`, the ID of the chain in question (ex: 5).
- `network`, the specific network corresponding to the chain ID (ex: Goerli)

```dart Dart
final chainInfo = await ParticleAuth.getChainInfo();
int id = chainInfo.id;
String name = chainInfo.name;
String network = chainInfo.network;
```

### Set Security Account Config

Another important component of integrating the Particle Auth SDK (Wallet-as-a-Service) is the (optional) security account requirements enforced upon application users. For all accounts on Particle, several security options are associated (such as a master password for a login-based non-recoverable password, payment password for a pin required upon transaction signatures, etc.)

Within the SDK, you can configure the frequency (or requirement) a user is asked to configure security settings. This is controlled with `ParticleAuth.setSecurityAccountConfig` and passing in a `SecurityAccountConfig` object with two parameters:

1. `promptSettingWhenSign`, security account config prompts (default is 1).
2. `promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenLogin`, master password prompts (default is 0).

- `0` means a prompt is never shown requesting this setting.
- `1` means a prompt is shown only upon the first startup.
- `2` means a prompt is shown every time.
- `3` means force set payment password before sign.

```dart Dart
final config = SecurityAccountConfig(1, 2);
ParticleAuth.setSecurityAccountConfig(config);
```

### Open Account and Security Page

Following the above, if you'd like to force the opening of account/security settings (in-UI), you can do so with `ParticleAuth.openAccountAndSecurity`.

```dart Dart
await ParticleAuth.openAccountAndSecurity();
```

### Open Web Wallet (deprecated in particle_auth_core)

Alternatively,  to use `ParticleAuth.openWebWallet` in particle_auth  (deprecated).

If you'd like to open the complete wallet UI (for most chains, this includes swaps, bridging, etc., alongside various wallet settings) in a standalone web interface with specific configurations, then you can call `ParticleAuth.openWebWallet`. For more information on the specific configurations possible here, see the [Wallet SDK page](/api/wallet/desktop/web).

```dart Dart
String webConfig =
    '''
     {
        "supportAddToken": false,
        "supportChains": [{
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Ethereum"
          },
          {
            "id": 5,
            "name": "Ethereum"
          }
        ]
      }
    ''';
    
ParticleAuth.openWebWallet(webConfig);  
```

### Has Master Password, Payment Password, Security Account

Similarly to the `isLogin` function covered prior, there are various scenarios in which knowing whether or not a user has specific security settings enabled may be useful. In the case of the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, this can happen in one of two ways:

With the built-in `ParticleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword`, `ParticleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword`, and `ParticleAuthCore.changeMasterPassword` methods.

Alternatively,  to use particle_auth (deprecated), you can call `ParticleAuth.hasMasterPassword`, `ParticleAuth.hasPaymentPassword`,`ParticleAuth.hasSecurityAccount` and `ParticleAuth.getSecurityAccount` methods.

```dart Dart

await ParticleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword();
await ParticleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword();
await ParticleAuthCore.changeMasterPassword();


// Alternatively,  to use particle_auth (deprecated)
await ParticleAuth.hasMasterPassword();
await ParticleAuth.hasPaymentPassword();
await ParticleAuth.hasSecurityAccount();

final securityAccount = await ParticleAuth.getSecurityAccount();
```

## `EvmService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuth` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Flutter SDK also includes a class, `EvmService`, for general interaction with EVM chains.

### Write Contract

`EvmService.writeContract` allows you to execute a write contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

```dart Dart
String contractAddress = "your contract address";
String methodName = "your method name"; // this is your contract method name, like balanceOf, mint.
List<Object> params = <Object>["0x1"]; // this is the method params.

// abi json string, you can get it from your contract developer.
// such as
// [{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"quantity\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"mint\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}]
const abiJsonString = null;
final result = EvmService.writeContract(publicAddress, contractAddress, methodName, params, abiJsonString, gasFeeLevel: GasFeeLevel.high);
```

### Read Contract

`EvmService.readContract` allows you to execute a read-only contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

```dart Dart
String publicAddress = "your public address";
String contractAddress = "your contract address"; 
String methodName ="your method name"; // ex: balanceOf, mint
List<Object> parameters = <Object>["0x1"];

// ex: [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"quantity","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"mint","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]  
const abiJsonString = null;

final result = await EvmService.readContract(publicAddress, contractAddress, methodName, parameters, abiJsonString);
```

### Create Transaction

`EvmService.createTransaction` facilitates the construction of a transaction object derived from the standard `from`, `to` (`receiver` in this example), `amount` (`value`), and `data` fields. This transaction, once constructed with `EvmService.createTransaction`, can be passed for in-UI proposal with `ParticleAuth.signAndSendTransaction`.

```dart Dart
String from = "your public address";
String receiver = "to address"  
String contractAddress = "contract address"
BigInt amount = "some amount";
String to = contractAddress;
final erc20Resp = 
    await EvmService.erc20Transfer(contractAddress, receiver, amount);
// Example of data generation
final data = jsonDecode(erc20Resp)["result"]; // 0x for native transfers

final transaction = await EvmService.createTransaction(
    from, data, BigInt.from(0), to,
    gasFeeLevel: GasFeeLevel.high);
```

### Estimate Gas

Given a standard transaction structure (detached set of values, as shown below), gas estimations can be ran to simulate and retrieve the volume of gas to be consumed by a specified transaction (wrapper for `eth_estimateGas`). This is done through `EvmService.evmEstimateGas`.

```dart Dart
final result = await EvmService.evmEstimateGas(from, to, value, data);
```

### Get Suggested Gas Fees

To retrieve categorized gas price suggestions (3 categories scaling from low to high) based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.suggestedGasFees`.

```dart Dart
await EvmService.suggestedGasFees();
```

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`EvmService` also extends to Data API methods such as `getTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of.

```dart Dart
await EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress);
```

### Get Transactions by Address

Similar to the former method, `EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress` enables the retrieval of a detailed JSON response containing a complete list of transactions involving a specified address.

```dart Dart
await EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress(publicAddress);
```

### Get price

To retrieve token price based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.getPrice`.

```dart Dart
 await EvmService.getPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Basic rpc method

Call any basic EVM rpc method through `EvmService.rpc`

```dart Dart
await EvmService.rpc(method, params);
```

## `SolanaService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuth` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Flutter SDK also includes a class, `SolanaService`, for general interaction with Solana chains.

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`SolanaService` also extends to Data API methods such as `getTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of SPL tokens and NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `SolanaService.getTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of.

```dart Dart
await SolanaService.getTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress, true);
```

### Serialize Transactions

`SolanaService.serializeSolTransaction`  facilitates the construction of a SOL transaction object,

`SolanaService.serializeSplTokenTransaction`  facilitates the construction of a Spl-token transaction object,

`SolanaService.serializeWSolTokenTransaction` facilitates the construction of a unwrap wsol transaction object. 

These transactions, once constructed , can be passed for in-UI proposal with `ParticleAuth.signAndSendTransaction`.

<CodeGroup>
```Text SOL
final transaction = SerializeSOLTransaction();  
transaction.lamports = TestAccount.solana.amount.toInt();  
transaction.receiver = TestAccount.solana.publicAddress;  
transaction.sender = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeSolTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```
```Text Spl-Token
final transaction = SerializeSplTokenTransaction();
transaction.amount = TestAccount.solana.amount.toInt();
transaction.receiver = TestAccount.solana.publicAddress;
transaction.mint = TestAccount.solana.tokenContractAddress;
transaction.sender = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeSplTokenTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```
```Text Unwrap WSOL
final transaction = SerializeWSOLTransaction();
transaction.address = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeWSolTokenTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get price

To retrieve token price based upon current network conditions, you can call `SolanaService.getPrice`.

```text SOL
 await SolanaService.getPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Get transactions by address

To retrieve transactions from a address, you can call `SolanaService.getTransactionsByAddress`.

```text SOL
await SolanaService.getTransactionsByAddress(address);
```

### Get token by token address

To obtain the balance of a specified token at a specified address, you can call `SolanaService.getTokenByTokenAddresses`

```text SOL
await SolanaService.getTokenByTokenAddresses(address, tokenAddresses);
```

### Basic rpc method

Call any basic Solana rpc method through `SolanaService.rpc`

```text SOL
await SolanaService.rpc(method, params);
```

## Master reference

For a direct, raw view into every method provided through `ParticleAuth`, below is a table containing every relevant method alongside specific parameters and a short description.
