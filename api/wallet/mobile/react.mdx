# Particle Wallet for React Native

Particle Wallet is a central wallet interface facilitating interaction with both social logins (via Particle Auth) and external Web3 wallets. Particle Wallet works closely with Particle Connect to provide a standard UI for the utilization of associated/connected accounts. Particle Wallet is built to be relatively application-specific through significant customization potential and built-in modularization.

Configuration and utilization processes **are detailed below**.

## Repository

Before jumping in, it may be worth looking at the [Particle Wallet React Native GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-react-native/tree/master/particle-wallet) to contextualize the SDK with a preliminary understanding of the underlying architecture and implementation flow by viewing the source code alongside included demos.

***

## Getting Started

The setup process for the Particle Wallet React Native SDK is quite similar to the Particle Auth and Particle Connect setup process, although it deviates slightly.

Before diving into platform-specific configuration, all Particle Wallet (& Connect/Auth) SDKs require three standard values for initialization: `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`, all of which can be retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

1. Sign up/log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/login.png"
  alt="Particle Network login."
/>

2. Create a new project or enter an existing project.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/project.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

3. Create a new application, or skip this step if you already have one.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/mobile-sdks/images/apps.png"
  alt="Particle Network project."
/>

4. Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/api/auth/desktop-sdks/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Particle Network app credentials."
/>

### Adding the Particle Wallet React Native SDK to your application

Another constant in the setup process is the installation of `@particle-network/rn-wallet`, either through npm or Yarn, depending on your preference.

```shell Terminal
npm install @particle-network/rn-wallet

// Or

yarn add @particle-network/rn-wallet
```

### Android configuration

If you're planning on using Android for your React Native application, ensure you're meeting the following prerequisites (otherwise, expect issues or non-functionality):

- Targets **API Level 23** (Marshmallow) or higher.
- Uses **Android 6.0** or higher.
- Uses **Jetpack** (Android X).
- Uses **Java 11**.

Once you've made sure your project meets these requirements, you'll need to move on and define the aforementioned configuration values (`projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`) within your `build.grade` file (generally found at `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`). These directly link your application's instance of Particle Connect with the [dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Specifically, within `build.gradle`, you'll need to set four different values:

1. `dataBinding`, this should be enabled with `enabled = true`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
      ......
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "your project id"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "your project client key"
      manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "your app id"
  }
  
  dataBinding {
      enabled = true
  }

}
```

***

### iOS configuration

To use iOS for your React Native application, you'll need to ensure that your project meets the following requirements:

- **Xcode 15.0** or later.

- **iOS 14** or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `ios/{project name}.xcworkspace`.

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

From here, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY` (`clientKey`), and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

Next, you'll need to head over to your `AppDelegate.swift` file to add an import of `react_native_particle_connect`, which Particle Wallet depends on in a large capacity.

```swift Swift
#import <react_native_particle_connect/react_native_particle_connect-Swift.h>
```

Additionally, within your application's `application` method (as shown below), you'll need to include a handler condition derived from `ParticleConnectSchemeManager handleUrl:url`. This should be as simple as a `YES` (true) return upon a truthy value of `ParticleConnectSchemeManager handleUrl:url`.

```swift Swift
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {
  if ([ParticleConnectSchemeManager handleUrl:url] == YES) {
    return YES;
  } else {
    // other methods
  }
  return YES;
}
```

Wrapping up, you'll need to configure your application's scheme URL. To configure this, select your application from "TARGETS" under the "Info" section, then click "+" to add a URL type.

This should simply be set to "pn" + your `projectId` (retrieved and configured prior), resulting in a scheme URL that looks something like the following:

```text
pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f
```

Additionally, head over to your `Info.plist` file and include the following snippet.

```xml XML
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>imtokenv2</string>
    <string>metamask</string>
    <string>phantom</string>
    <string>bitkeep</string>
    <string>trust</string>
    <string>rainbow</string>
    <string>zerion</string>
    <string>mathwallet</string>
    <string>1inch</string>
    <string>awallet</string>
    <string>okex</string>
</array>
```

Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_connect` (which, as mentioned, Particle Wallet depends on) is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://pub.dev/packages/particle_auth/install) to complete this if you have not already.

## Examples of Utilization

### Initialization

The Particle Wallet SDK won't function until initialization occurs. This will set several key parameters used and required by the wallet interface. Specifically, this is done through `particleWallet.initWallet`, which takes one parameter, `walletMetaData`. This should a `DappMetaData` object containing:

- `walletConnectProjectId`, your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).
- `name`, the name of your project.
- `icon`, your project's logo - ideally 512x512.
- `url`, the URL of your project's website.
- `description`, a brief description of your project.
- Optionally, `redirect` and `verifyUrl`.

If you're also using Particle Connect within the same file, you can call `init`, passing in `chainInfo` and `env`. For more information on Particle Connect, see the [Particle Connect React Native SDK](https://particlenetwork.readme.io/reference/react-native-javascript-1).

```js JavaScript
import * as particleWallet from '@particle-network/rn-wallet';
import * as particleConnect from '@particle-network/rn-connect';
import * as ParticleAuthCore from '@particle-network/rn-auth-core';

const chainInfo = PolygonAmoy;
const env = Env.Dev;
const metaData = {
  walletConnectProjectId: 'your wallet connect project id, get it from wallet connect',
  name: 'Particle Connect',
  icon: 'https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png',
  url: 'https://connect.particle.network',
  description: 'Particle Wallet',
};
particleConnect.init(chainInfo, env, metaData);
ParticleAuthCore.init();
particleWallet.initWallet(metaData);
```

### Open Wallet

To open the main (front) page of the wallet interface, you can call `particleWallet.navigatorWallet`. This only takes one parameter, `display`, which should be a binary choice, (`0`, or `1`), that dictates whether the front page includes general token balances (`0`), or NFT balances (`1`). E.g.:

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorWallet(display);
```

### Open Token Receive

`particleWallet.navigatorTokenReceive` opens a page dedicated to receiving tokens, through both a general address and a QR code. This takes one optional parameter, `tokenAddress`, that can change the associated QR code to be specific to a given token, including its icon at the center of the QR code image. E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorTokenReceive(tokenAddress);
```

### Open Token Send

You can also open a page for sending tokens (ERC20/SPL/native) directly to other addresses. This can be done through `particleWallet.navigatorTokenSend`, optionally passing in the following parameters to predefine (fill in) specific values within the page:

- `tokenAddress`, the contract address of the token to be sent, can be set to `native` for the default/native network token.
- `toAddress`, the recipient's address.
- `amount`, the volume of `tokenAddress` that'll be sent to `toAddress`.

E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorTokenSend(tokenAddress, toAddress, amount);
```

### Open Transaction Records

It's also quite simple to open a page containing transaction records (history) for a connected wallet: `particleWallet.navigatorTokenTransactionRecords`. If you'd like to filter these records only to show entries that include a specific token, then you can pass in a `tokenAddress` representing the token to be filtered. E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorTokenTransactionRecords(tokenAddress);
```

### Open NFT Send

Alike `navigatorTokenSend`, you can use `particleWallet.navigatorNFTSend` to prompt a page for sending a specific NFT (defined by a `mint`/`contractAddress` and `tokenId`) to another address. `navigatorNFTSend` takes three parameters:

- `receiverAddress`, the recipient's address.
- `mint` (also known as `contractAddress`), the address of the NFT contract to be sent.
- `tokenId`, the token ID for the specific NFT associated with `mint`. This can be set as `null` for Solana.

E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorNFTSend(receiverAddress, mint, tokenId);
```

### Open NFT Details

To open the details of a specific NFT (image, attributes, description, etc.) on-screen, you'll need to call `particleWallet.navigatorNFTDetails` by passing in `mint` (`contractAddress`) and the associated `tokenId` that you'd like to view. E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorNFTDetails(mint, tokenId);
```

### Open Buy Crypto

Particle Wallet also has a native onramp aggregator (featuring providers like Transak, FatPay, AlchemyPay, etc.), allowing users to bring fiat on-chain through various onramp providers. Opening this programmatically can happen through `particleWallet.navigatorBuyCrypto`, passing in several optional parameters to customize the values used within the onramp. Upon calling, this will throw a popup or total redirect over to a corresponding configuration of https://ramp.particle.network.

The specific parameters that can be used within `navigatorBuyCrypto` are listed below:

| Name          | Description                                                              | Type   | Required                                 |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| network       | [Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Tron, Optimism, etc.]   | string | False _(True if Particle not connected)_ |
| fiatCoin      | Fiat currency denomination.                                              | string | False                                    |
| cryptoCoin    | Cryptocurrency denomination.                                             | string | False                                    |
| fiatAmt       | The amount of fiat to be automatically filled in as the purchase volume. | number | False                                    |
| bool          | Lock selection of fiat currency in the buy menu.                         | bool   | False                                    |
| fixCryptoCoin | Lock selection of cryptocurrency in the buy menu.                        | bool   | False                                    |
| fixFiatAmt    | Lock selection of fiat amount in the buy menu.                           | bool   | False                                    |
| walletAddress | The wallet address to receive the cryptocurrency.                        | string | False _(True if Particle not connected)_ |

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorBuyCrypto();

const config = new BuyCryptoConfig("0xa0869E99886e1b6737A4364F2cf9Bb454FD637E4", "BNB", "USD", 1000, OpenBuyNetwork.BinanceSmartChain);
particleWallet.navigatorBuyCrypto(config);
```

### Open Swap

Particle Wallet features a built-in swap widget, aggregating multiple providers such as 1inch to initiate and execute swaps. This widget/interface can be thrown by using `particleWallet.navigatorSwap`, and optionally passing in the following parameters (can work without them):

- `fromTokenAddress`, the contract address for the token being swapped.
- `toTokenAddress`, the contract address for the token being swapped to.
- `amount`, the volume of `fromTokenAddress` to be swapped.

E.g.

```js JavaScript
particleWallet.navigatorSwap(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, amount);
```

### Set Supported Chains

Narrowing the specific chains supported/accessible within the Particle Wallet interface can be done through `particleWallet.setSupportChain`, which takes an array of `ChainInfo` objects (imported from `@particle-network/chains`). Network options will be confined to the corresponding chains within this array. E.g.

```js JavaScript
const chainInfos = [Ethereum, Polygon];
particleWallet.setSupportChain(chainInfos);
```

### Switch Wallet

You can also switch the `walletType` being used within Particle Wallet. For example, if you're using Metamask as a wallet type within Particle Wallet and would like to switch to Particle (social logins), this would be the method you'd use. You can initiate this switch through `particleWallet.switchWallet`, passing in the new `walletType` object (of type `WalletType`), and the targeted user address of the current active session. E.g.

```js JavaScript
WalletType walletType = WalletType.particle;
String result = await particleWallet.switchWallet(walletType, publicAddress);
```

## Custom UI

Particle Wallet can also undergo additional customization, specifically regarding which UI elements are shown and how. Each of these configurations are accessed through a unique method on `particleWallet` (`@particle-network/rn-wallet`). These methods include (but are not limited to):

- `setDisplayTokenAddresses`, an asynchronous function to set specific token addresses to be displayed in the Particle Wallet. It takes an array of token addresses as a parameter, `tokenAddresses`.

- `setDisplayNFTContractAddresses`, an asynchronous function for setting specific NFT contract addresses to be displayed in the Particle Wallet. This function accepts an array of NFT contract addresses, `nftContractAddresses`.

- `setPriorityTokenAddresses`, an async function that prioritizes certain token addresses to appear at the top of lists within the Particle Wallet. It requires an array of token addresses, `tokenAddresses`.

- `setPriorityNFTContractAddresses`, an asynchronous function to prioritize specific NFT contract addresses in the Particle Wallet, making them appear at the top of lists. It takes an array of NFT contract addresses, `nftContractAddresses`.

- `setShowLanguageSetting`, an async function to toggle the visibility of the language setting option in the Particle Wallet. It takes a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

- `setShowAppearanceSetting`, an asynchronous function that controls the display of the appearance setting in the Particle Wallet. It accepts a Boolean parameter, either `true` or `false`.

- `setSupportAddToken`, an async function to toggle the option to add tokens in the Particle Wallet. It takes a Boolean value of `true` or `false`.

E.g.

```js JavaScript
setDisplayTokenAddresses = async () => {
  const tokenAddresses = ["", ""];
  particleWallet.setDisplayTokenAddresses(tokenAddresses);
}

setDisplayNFTContractAddresses = async () => {
  const nftContractAddresses = ["", ""];
  particleWallet.setDisplayNFTContractAddresses(nftContractAddresses); 
}

setPriorityTokenAddresses = async () => {
  const tokenAddresses = ["", ""];
  particleWallet.setPriorityTokenAddresses(tokenAddresses);
}

setPriorityNFTContractAddresses = async () => {
  const nftContractAddresses = ["", ""];
  particleWallet.setPriorityNFTContractAddresses(nftContractAddresses);
}

setShowLanguageSetting = async () => {
  particleWallet.setShowLanguageSetting(false); 
}

setShowAppearanceSetting = async () => {
  particleWallet.setShowAppearanceSetting(false);
}
  
setSupportAddToken = async () => {
  particleWallet.setSupportAddToken(false); 
}
```
