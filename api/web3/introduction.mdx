# Web3 Services

Among its Wallet-as-a-Service and Account Abstraction SDKs suite, Particle Network also offers a multitude of API endpoints designed to **facilitate high-speed, flexible blockchain interactions**. These interactions range from detailed **data retrieval** (of key information such as the tokens owned by a wallet), to ERC-20 **swap construction** and **IPFS capabilities**. Each collection of endpoints remains as a simple yet powerful solution for programmatically reading data and writing to the blockchain. In addition to the endpoints covered in this section, many of these capabilities are also natively accessible through Particle's various SDKs. These adjacent methods are detailed in [SDK Reference](ref:evmservice-sdk-reference) (and [SDK Reference](ref:solanaservice-sdk-reference) for Solana).

Under **Web3 Services**, we provide a transparent and detailed look into the various endpoints offered by Particle Network, including an interactive playground for each endpoint, alongside multiple examples.
